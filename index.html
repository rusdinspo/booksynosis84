<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Crabs and Oysters: a Savor the South cookbook (Savor the South Cookbooks)</h2><p>Crabs and oysters take center stage as Chef Bill Smith conveys his passion for preparing these sumptuous shellfish long associated with southern coastlines. Smith's sensibilities as a North Carolinian born and raised down east are vibrantly on display as he recalls the joy of growing up catching crabs and shucking oysters. Smith traveled the coastline, visited with crab fishermen and oyster farmers, and dove deep into a library's worth of regional cookbooks and collections of heirloom recipes from seaside communities, notably in North Carolina and Louisiana. His collection of fifty recipes, organized by courses, ranges from simple, everyday preparations to elaborate ones suitable for fancy parties. From Crabmeat Cobbler, Roasted Oysters, and Hard-Crab Stew with White Cornmeal Dumplings, to Crabmeat Ravigotte and Oyster Shortcake, cooks will find a succulent recipe for every occasion. The book includes seasonal selection information and detailed cleaning and preparation instructions for hard- and soft-shell crabs and oysters.<br><br></p><p>Bill Smith is the chef at Crook's Corner Restaurant in Chapel Hill, N.C., and author of <i>Seasoned in the South: Recipes and Stories from Crook's Corner and Home</i>, a <i>New York Times</i> notable cookbook and <i>Food &amp; Wine</i> Best-of-the-Best cookbook. A Southern Foodways Alliance board member, Smith has twice been named as a finalist for best chef in the South by the James Beard Foundation and was nominated for a sustainability award by the Chef's Collaborative.A readable and intimate cookbook that doubles as a memoir.--<i>Independent Weekly</i><br><br></p><h2>Loch Garman: A Novel of Viking Age Ireland (The Norsemen Saga)</h2><p>Driven ashore on the coast of Ireland, their longships nearly wrecked by the gods who seem unwilling to let them leave, Thorgrim Night Wolf and his band of Northmen once again face a fight for their survival. Helpless without their ships, they must find some refuge in that hostile country and begin the laborious work of making the vessels seaworthy again. But for all the shipbuilding skills that Thorgrim and the others possess, there is one thing they cannot do&#x2014;weave cloth to replace the sails shredded in the gale that drove them ashore. For that they must strike a bargain with the Irish, the very people who most want them dead. But no such bargain can last for long, and soon betrayal and deceit have the Northmen trapped by an enemy determined to crush them once and for all.</p><p>Jim Nelson was born and raised in Maine and graduated from UCLA with a degree in motion picture/television production. Finding that despite being in Southern California, it was a damp, drizzly November in his soul, Jim took the cure Melville recommended and decided to sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. For six years he worked on board traditional sailing ships before launching a writing career as in 1994. He has since written more than twenty works of maritime fiction and history. He is the winner or the American Library Association/William Young Boyd Award and the Naval Order&#x2019;s Samuel Eliot Morison Award. Nelson has lectured all over the country and appeared on the Discovery Channel, History Channel and BookTV. He currently lives in Harpswell, Maine, with his former shipmate, now wife Lisa and three of their four children.</p><h2>Road Fever</h2><p>Tim Cahill reports on the road trip to end all road trips: a journey that took him from Tierra del Fuego to Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, in a record-breaking twenty three and a half days.</p><p>If you define "adventure travel" as anything that's more fun to read about than to live through, then Tim Cahill's <i>Road Fever</i> is the adventure of a lifetime. Along with professional long-distance driver Garry Sowerby, Cahill drove 15,000 miles from the southernmost tip of Tierra del Fuego to the northernmost terminus of the Dalton Highway in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, from one end of the world to another, in a record-breaking 23 1/2 days. Just like the authors' camper-shelled GMC Sierra truck, the narrative bounces along at a relentless pace. Along the way Cahill and Sowerby cope with mood swings, engine trouble, Andean cliffs, obstinate bureaucracies, slick highways, armed and uncomprehending soldiery (not to mention the challenges of securing O.P.M., or Other People's Money--the <i>sine qua non</i> of adventure, Cahill observes). Author of such off-the-wall travelogues as <i>Pass the Butterworms</i> and <i>Jaguars Ripped My Flesh</i>, Cahill is equipped with the correct amalgam of chutzpah and dementia to survive what can only be called "The Road Trip From Hell." Readers, however, will thoroughly enjoy themselves.<b>Tim Cahill</b> is the author of nine books, including&nbsp;<i>A Wolverine Is Eating My Leg, Jaguars Ripped My Flesh,&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;Pass the Butterworms.&nbsp;</i>He is an editor at large for&nbsp;<i>Outside</i>&nbsp;magazine, and his work appears in&nbsp;<i>National Geographic Adventure, The New York Times Book Review,&nbsp;</i>and other national publications. He lives in Montana.</p><h2>Fraying at the Edge: A Novel (The Amish of Summer Grove)</h2><p><b>Family, community, faith, and love.</b><br> <b>These &#x201c;quilt blocks&#x201d; sewn together made Ariana&#x2019;s beautiful life.</b><br> <b>When they are pulled to pieces,</b><br> <b>will anything familiar remain?</b><br><br>The Old Order Amish life Ariana Brenneman loved vanished virtually overnight with the discovery that she was switched at birth twenty years ago. Now she&#x2019;s immersed in the&nbsp;<i>Englischer</i>&nbsp;world, getting to know her mother and under the authority of her biological father, an atheist intellectual with resolute plans to expand Ariana&#x2019;s worldview. Only Quill Schlabach, a childhood friend living&nbsp;<i>Englisch</i>, can steady the tilting ground between Ariana&#x2019;s two worlds, but can she trust him after so many betrayals?<br> &nbsp;<br> At the same time, Skylar Nash is forced to choose rehab or spend several months with her true relatives, the large Brenneman family and their seemingly backward life&#x2014;no electricity, no technology, no fun. What the young woman can&#x2019;t leave behind is her addiction to illegal prescription drugs and a deep emptiness from the belief that she doesn&#x2019;t belong in either family.<br> &nbsp;<br> New ties are binding Ariana and Skylar to the lives they were meant to have. Can they find the wisdom and strength they&#x2019;ll need to follow God&#x2019;s threads into unexpected futures?<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Fraying at the</i>&nbsp;Edge is the second novel in The Amish of Summer Grove series.</p><p><b>Cindy Woodsmall</b>&nbsp;is the <i>New York Times</i> and CBA best-selling author of eighteen works of fiction and nonfiction with more than a million copies sold. Her connection with the Amish community has been featured in national media outlets such as ABC&#x2019;s <i>Nightline</i>, the<i> Wall Street Journal</i>, and a <i>National Geographic</i> documentary on Amish life.

The pale moonlight only intensified the darkness that surrounded her, as if the blackness were a picture of what was happening to her family. To her daughters. <br><br> She tightened her interlaced fingers. Her knees ached from the hours she had quietly sought God for the kind of help only He could give. <br><br> The daughter she&#x2019;d thought she had given birth to two decades ago was gone, spending her first night with strangers in an <i>Englisch </i>home that by all accounts was worldly and in disarray. From what little she knew, that home was dysfunctional at best. She was terrified for the daughter she&#x2019;d raised, the one who had none of her DNA. <br><br> Until recently Lovina hadn&#x2019;t realized that even God&#x2019;s faithful ones endured the kind of terror that had now entrenched itself in her heart. But maybe the truth was Lovina hadn&#x2019;t been faithful, not truly. <br><br> &#x201c;God, please don&#x2019;t let Ariana or Skylar pay the price for my sin.&#x201d; <br><br> How would Ariana&#x2014;Lovina&#x2019;s sweet, wide-eyed girl&#x2014;survive for a year outside the Amish community she loved with her whole heart? <br><br> The daughter Lovina had actually given birth to was upstairs, sharing a bedroom with her sisters for the first time in her twenty-year life. The image of meeting Skylar yesterday for the first time made Lovina break into fresh sobs. Her daughter had black nails that matched the dyed-black streak in her blond hair. And she wore jewelry, makeup, and revealing clothes. But none of that had twisted Lovina&#x2019;s heart in a knot like the hardï¿½ness she saw in Skylar, as if bitterness had already destroyed her belief in life and humanity. The young woman wasn&#x2019;t hopeless. She had dreams but no apparent understanding that life and people were valuable. Even with all that, the most painful part of yesterday was when Skylar&#x2019;s driver, Quill Schlabach, handed Lovina the luggage and suggested she thoroughly inspect it to verify Skylar hadn&#x2019;t brought any drugs with her. <br><br> Lovina had set the luggage aside for a while and tried to connect with Skylar about little things&#x2014;her hobbies, schooling, and such. Later, when the two of them were alone, Lovina went through the suitcase as Skylar sat on the bed, calmly and apathetically assuring her that she&#x2019;d only popped a few pills on occasion and that a random drug test happened to catch her right after one such rare event. Lovina found no drugs, but Skylar&#x2019;s calm, detached behavior toward meeting her family, having a twin, and the drug search was disconcerting.<br><br> &#x201c;Father in heaven, please strengthen Skylar to overcome all desire for pills&#x2014;occasional or otherwise.&#x201d;<br><br> It was her fault Skylar was in this predicament. Just as it was her fault Ariana had been forced to leave here and go to a dysfunctional home. Would Lovina spend the rest of her life carrying this unbearable sense of blame? <br><br> When the floor creaked, Lovina lifted her forehead from her folded hands. Her husband stood in the doorway between the kitchen and the living room, bathed in shadows and dressed in yesterday&#x2019;s pants with susï¿½penders pulled over a white T-shirt. <br><br> He eased toward her, knelt, and put an arm around her shoulders. &#x201c;God, help my Lovina,&#x201d; he whispered, and then he kissed her temple. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be okay. It will.&#x201d; <br><br> Lovina didn&#x2019;t need or want false words of hope, but maybe God had spoken to Isaac. Maybe He hadn&#x2019;t. She wouldn&#x2019;t ask. <br><br> Skylar had spent a lifetime being indoctrinated in ways Lovina had little knowledge of. In fact, she would be in rehab right now were it not for these crazy circumstances. <br><br> Lovina&#x2019;s need to confess her sin to her husband weighed heavily. &#x201c;The unbearable part is I did this.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Shh.&#x201d; He held her tight, probably trying to ease her trembling. &#x201c;No, my love. This isn&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;But it is. Please, I have to say it aloud to someone . . . at least once.&#x201d; <br><br> He nodded. &#x201c;Then say it a thousand times if it will help.&#x201d; <br><br> Lovina wiped her tears. &#x201c;When I doubted that we had the right newï¿½born, I didn&#x2019;t push hard enough to get answers.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;But Rachel dismissed your fears.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Rachel meant well, but as a midwife she didn&#x2019;t have a mother&#x2019;s heart. I should&#x2019;ve pushed harder for answers then.&#x201d; She sobbed. &#x201c;And twenty years later when I discovered the truth about the girls being swapped, I pushed too hard, too fast. Quill tried to warn me, telling me I needed to slow down. But I forged ahead, thinking Skylar needed the faith we could offer her. But we&#x2019;re in over our heads with that one. I see that now. I&#x2019;ve upended both girls&#x2019; lives. Ariana is there, and . . .&#x201d; She broke into fresh tears. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a horrible person, Isaac.&#x201d; <br><br> He wrapped her in his arms and held her tight. &#x201c;God will forgive us.&#x201d; <br><br> Even he couldn&#x2019;t muster another denial of their guilt. This nightmare was Lovina&#x2019;s fault, and no matter how it played out, her daughters&#x2014;yes, she considered both of them her daughters&#x2014;would pay the price. Who knew how high a price? All the regret of her past failures and all the fear of her daughters&#x2019; futures weighed on her mother&#x2019;s heart, squeezing and pressï¿½ing until she didn&#x2019;t think she could take any more. <br><br> As much as she believed in forgiveness and redemption, she wasn&#x2019;t sure any existed for her. God could forgive her, and He could redeem her&nbsp;from eternal damnation. But that wouldn&#x2019;t undo or erase two decades of planting and harvesting in Skylar&#x2019;s life.<br><br> Clarity came to her like dawn dispelling night, and she knew why the burden of her sin was so very heavy tonight. Darkness was stretching toï¿½ward Ariana, and Lovina needed to pray fervently, because her sweet girl would soon be in a fight for her sanity.</p><h2>The World in Vogue: People, Parties, Places</h2><p><b>A stunning collection of 300 photographs of some of the most celebrated actors, artists, models, First Ladies, and social figures from around the world,&nbsp;<b>drawing on stories from the pages of&nbsp;<i>Vogue</i>&nbsp;as well as never-before-published images by iconic photographers.</b></b><br><br>These trendsetters and newsmakers are captured by such famous photographers as Cecil Beaton, Jonathan Becker, Eric Boman, Horst P.

In it, Neale joined with Laurie Lankins Farley and Emily Filmore, the directors of the School of the New Spirituality, to write a parenting book to awaken parents to the everyday life principles and practices of new thought parenting. &nbsp;<br>They wanted to make available for parents not only the tools for teaching and parenting through CWG's concepts, but a narrative summary of the concepts themselves. They knew this special articulation for parents would form the backbone of their spiritual home and guide their parenting efforts. This book will also assist parents, should they decide to use the other tools being created by our School with maximum effectiveness.&nbsp; This 384 page book for parents is not a workbook -- it is an unique and inspiring parenting book, with content that will help parents guide their children through the core concepts from the 3,000 pages of&nbsp;<i>Conversations with God</i></i><i><i>, strengthening the next generation and reminding children Who They Really Are.</i></i></i><i><i><i><em>&nbsp;</em></i></i></i><em><em>Each chapter is presented in two parts: (1) A narrataive for parents that includes background information and interpretative commentary on the spiritual concepts being explored; and (2)Tools with which parents may effectively share these concepts with their children.

This happens the way it does so we can integrate throughout every level of our being what was already known "at the beginning." Thanks to this process, the little self (our personality) has a way to unify with the greater self (our soul). What results can make us stronger, more confident and intelligent, more compassionate ... whole.<br><br>We are not here to be spiritual. Does that surprise you? Nor are we here to be bully prophets or wealthy tyrants, or, to save the world. Such are examples of backward thinking that gets us nowhere.<br><br>As humans, we exist in partnership between the seen and the unseen. Our breath is the potential we volley between the Great Breath and the Great Breathing, connecting life with Life. We entrer this world on an in-breath, we leave on an out-breath. Back and forth, motion and rest. Our job during our many journeys:&nbsp;<em>remember who we are and act accordingly</em>. Making the world a better place depends on this.</p>|<p><strong>WHAT THIS MANUAL IS<br><br></strong>Consider this manual an invitation for you ... to think for yourself ... take control of your life, both its unfoldment and the responsibility that comes with that unfoldment ... and align yourself with the directive of your soul.<br><br>The underlying premise throughout is simple: If you can't use what you know to be true, it isn't worth knowing.<br><br>Each section is crammed with as many "how-tos," suggestions, and ideas as possible covering the six major areas of anyone's life: brain/mind, bodies, environments, relationships, life exercises, and guidance. And, each section is viewed three ways--initial (conscious), intimate (subconscious), and multiple (subconscious), and multiple (superconscious).<br><br>All material is an amalgam from what I've learned in the 80 years I have spent tearing up my enviroment, challenging then pushing every limit that stood in my way--exploring the corners of business, community service, relationships, mystical and alternate realities--then creating Inner Forum, Idaho's first non-profit metaphysical corporation devoted to separating truth from fiction. Well over 3,000 people took part in its programs. When I died, three times in three months in 1977, and each time had a near-death experience, the world I thought I knew ended. Another began when I was faced with relearning the basics from the bottom up: everything from crawling to walking, recognizing the difference between left and right, seeing and hearing properly, and rebuilding all my belief systems. The following year I initiated research on near-death states because I was told to during my third near-death experience. This investigation encompassed four decades, involved nearly 4,000 adult and child experiencers, and filled fifteen books--at least this writing (not to mention blogs, articles, and papers).<br><br>No explanation exists for the incessant drive I have always and still have, or my need to test everything. Yes, I was born with dyslexia and synesthesia, but even that does not explain the levels I have taken since childhood to refuse limitation. Early-on I discovered that no one is interested in your questions--they just want your answers. So, this time, with this manual, you will not find the usual footnotes, referrals, or appendices. I'm giving you what you said you wanted ... a manual that works.<br><br><em>A Manual for Developing Humans&nbsp;</em>is the "missing book," that third of the trilogy I was told to write when I died the third time. Actually, it was written first. Peer review at the time advised that I put the manuscript in a box and forget it. I did. In a very big box. That was the early eighties--never to be touched again until Robert Van de Castle died in 2014. Bob was a world authority on dreams and a dear friend. At his memorial, he manifested first in my car saying he knew I would come, and then again during the eulogy when he winked at me and said, "It is time." I knew what he meant. I drove straight home afterward and opened the box. You are reading the result.<br><br>You know, all of us are subjected to "tests" before we realize there's a "curriculum." That's why life is so puzzling. What seems beyond our control often shifts once we change our attitude and responses--and many times for the better. We make a difference, you and I. To prove it,&nbsp;<em>use&nbsp;</em>this manual ... Don't just read words and glance at the pictures.<br><br>Achieving success, status, and wealth is not a measure of life. Nor is becoming a religious or spiritual paragon of things holy. Undergoing an intense transformation of consciousness--through something akin to a near-death experience, baptism of the Holy Spirit, kundalini breakthrough, shamanic vision quest, numinous episode, being bathed in "light," deathbed visions, any of these--constitutes a single step ... an awakening.&nbsp;<em>However</em>, we can accomplish the same thing, reach that step, without all the drama such intene transformational events cause. Move past name and number, race and roots, and you automatically begin to enter realms of mind and memory that reveal a larger consciousness of truth. We recognize ourselves as co-creators with the Creator once that occurs. Years ago, people used to chant "hu" as a way to invoke this revelation, our identity as hu-mans ... gods in the making.<br><br>A feature in awakening to who we really are is the enchantment and alteration of faculties normal to us, plus, the very real possibility that thought-forms can become visible. Thought-forms are simply an issuance of energy that "out-pictures" an idea stream from a person's brain. To say it another way, when one thinks a thought, energy is released ... and that energy can be seen.<br><br>Twenty-eight thought-form drawings "popped" in for inclusion in the original version of this manual. I kept them intact to use as breaks between the various parts and sections. Each was an attempt at that time for me to depict a particular stage in the life of a thought when it moved from the energy that initiated it to form the shape words would eventually take. The phrasing on each drawing identifies the energy of the idea stream that produced it.</p></p><h2>Doomsday Preppers Complete Survival Manual: Expert Tips for Surviving Calamity, Catastrophe, and the End of the World</h2><p>This custom companion to the blockbuster National Geographic Channel&nbsp;series <i>Doomsday Preppers</i> is filled with how-to illustrations, "Prepper Profiles" of&nbsp;people in the show, and survival tips from preppers themselves.

Although he endures persistent threats just to attend lectures, he feels disconnected from his Jewish peers and questions whether their activism will be worth the cost. Spending his days walking the streets and his nights drinking and conversing with revolutionaries, zealots, and libertines, he remains isolated, even from the women he loves. From Bucharest to Paris, he strives to make peace with himself in an increasingly hostile world.<br><br> <i>For Two Thousand Years </i>echoes Mihail Sebastian&#x2019;s struggles as the rise of fascism ended his career and turned his friends and colleagues against him. Born of the violence of relentless anti-Semitism, his searching, self-derisive work captures a defining moment in history and lights the way for generations to come&#x2014;a prescient, heart-wrenching chronicle of resilience and despair, resistance and acceptance.</p><p><b>Mihail Sebastian </b>was born in Romania in 1907 as Iosef Hecter. He worked as a lawyer and writer until anti-Semitic legislation forced him to abandon his public career. Having survived the war and the Holocaust, he was killed in a road accident early in 1945 as he was crossing the street to teach his first class. His long-lost diary, <i>Journal 1935&#x2013;1944: The Fascist Years</i>, was published to great acclaim in the late 1990s."[T]his scintillating novel&#x2014;a fiery coming-of-age story introduced to the combustible material of extremist politics&#x2014;which wrestles with the question of how one should live in the face of hatred...reveals a young, idealistic man grasping for freedom from the external oppression of anti-Semitism but also, paradoxically, from the beholdens of his Jewish heritage. The diary entries (in a vigorous translation by Philip ï¿½ Ceallaigh ) follow the unnamed narrator from his time at university, when right-wing thugs beat up Jewish students when they attended classes, to his maturation as an emerging architect. The slender plot serves mostly as a vessel for passionate arguments...The narrator records his interactions with budding fascists, nihilists, Marxists and Zionists. But his fiercest debates are with himself. He yearns to stand apart from the collective suffering of Romanian Jews and cultivate his individuality...Many of Sebastian&#x2019;s characters are modeled on intellectuals who would have been well known to his Romanian readers but now require recondite web searching to identify. But the passage of time has also added gravity to a story that foreshadows yet cannot quite envision the genocide on the horizon.

It is really about the desire of human beings to maintain &#x201c;normalcy&#x201d; under the roughest of circumstances....Only a European could have written this book, and that in itself should make it interesting to Americans, especially now in our hard-to-believe Age of Donald Trump.

The psychological price it exacts is beautifully documented in For Two Thousand Years, but the physical price is even higher&#x2014;too high for anyone to agree to pay.&#x201d;<i><b> &#x2014;TABLET</b></i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;For Two Thousand Years is one of the most powerful stories of the rise of fascism to almost never make it into English translation....One of the key strengths of Sebastian&#x2019;s book lies in his masterful portrayal of the ebb and flow of anti-Semitism and fascism, and of the ease with which people who are friends and colleagues one day can be co-opted by fascist and racist ideas the next....Sebastian has masterfully captured the range of arguments used to express and justify anti-Semitism and illustrates both their circular logic as well as the tenacious self-righteousness that define them. To the modern educated reader they sound ridiculous, yet at the same time eerily resonant of contemporary forms of bigotry, and the arguments that drive them....Its depiction of the many faces of anti-Semitism, from workplace jokes between colleagues to street violence, is breath-taking in its horror yet also masterfully eloquent....Sebastian&#x2019;s book illustrates important realities of the rise of fascism and anti-Semitism.&#x201d; <br> <b>&#x2014;POPMATTERS</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;For Two Thousand Years&nbsp;is a profoundly moving novel... This Romanian work by Mihail Sebastian (1907-1945) provoked a scandal when it was published in 1934 for its unflinching description of anti-Semitic and Zionist themes, and it fell into obscurity for decades. Masterfully translated into English by Philip ï¿½ Ceallaigh... it is a powerful, beautifully written story that compares well with the work of Sebastian&#x2019;s contemporaries Mircea Eliade and Eugene Ionesco...&nbsp;For Two Thousand Years&nbsp;explores timeless themes of struggle and acceptance with power, grace, and insight."<i>&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;FOREWORD REVIEWS</b> </i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This novel, published in 1934 and ably translated for the first time into English, traces the path of its protagonist from his university days to a career as an architect, during which he frequently hears the cry &#x2018;Death to the Yids.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s so pervasive, in fact, that he seems inured to it and is shocked to learn by novel&#x2019;s end that several longtime Romanian colleagues have been anti-Semites all along...Laced throughout with debate regarding the place of the Jewish people and their culture in the world, among other issues, this work sits uneasily between philosophical speculation and narrative fiction. But it is an important historical document&#x2014;prophetically, the protagonist cries out, &#x2018;Has anybody had a greater need of a fatherland?&#x2019;&#x201d;&nbsp;<i><b>&#x2014;LIBRARY JOURNAL&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In For Two Thousand Years, Sebastian gives a vibrant inner life of a man reconciling himself with his historical moment. His account may be fictionalized, but it grows all the darker, all the more portentous as the story passes into the 1930s, on the edge of what today&#x2019;s readers know is to come for Jews in Romania and across Europe. Sebastian&#x2019;s words serve as unshakable evidence for Hannah Arendt&#x2019;s indictment, in Eichmann in Jerusalem, that Romania was &#x2018;the most anti-Semitic country in pre-war Europe. And the questions of identity Sebastian raised have persisted long after the war.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;MUSIC &amp; LITERATURE </b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;His prose is like something Chekov might have written &#x2013; the same modesty, candor, and subtleness of observation.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Arthur Miller</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;ARTHUR MILLER said that the Romanian Jewish writer Mihail Sebastian (1907-1945) wrote like Chekhov; Philip Roth that Sebastian&#x2019;s Journal 1935-1944 deserves to be on the same shelf as The Diary of Anne Frank and have just as huge a readership. Coming fresh from a reading of his 1934 novel, For Two Thousand Years, now available in English for the first time, I agree. The work is quietly eloquent as literature and illuminating as social history. Unfortunately, it was eclipsed by a devastation that it anticipated, predicted even, yet still could not imagine. The novel is both light and heavy, light writing and a heavy content &#x2014; Jewish mystique, Yiddish anxiety, Romanian stolidity, and antisemitism.&#x201d; <i><b>&#x2014;JEWISH CURRENTS </b></i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;The author has penned a shrewd autobiographical novel about his coming of age during a thriving but fractious decade leading up to World War II...The result is a searing vision of his fraught times&#x2014;draw near and you may also see our own.&#x201d;<i><b> &#x2014;FREDERICKSBURG FREE LANCE-STAR </b></i><br> &nbsp;<br> More than a fascinating historical document, it is also a coherent and persuasive novel...&nbsp;While [FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS] recreates the student&#x2019;s nightlife and love affairs, friendships and betrayals, it is a look at a world that was falling apart.&nbsp;We feel the tension and paranoia that preceded one of the bloodiest periods in the history of the 20th century, and what is so terrifying is that the same book could have been written today.

For Two Thousand Years&nbsp;by Mihail Sebastian is a hidden gem in European literature, shining a light on what happened in Romania between the wars.

The narrator is a university student who must endure daily beatings because he is Jewish. Even before Hitler initiated the slaughter of European Jews, Romania had begun murdering 300,000 of its own people. It is a dreamer&#x2019;s lamentation, yet not without humour.

She lives in Southern California with her husband, Allen, a large number of quilts, and twenty pairs of cowboy boots.Conflicting family loyalties and the burdens of the past lie at the heart of the engrossing seventh novel from four-time Agatha Award nominee Fowler to feature amateur sleuth Benni Harper. Benni's 19-year-old stepson, Sam Ortiz, confides in her that he and his pregnant girlfriend, Bliss Girard, a rookie cop in the San Celina, Calif., police department, want to marry. Benni fears that her husband, Gabe Ortiz, the town's police chief, will disapprove--and that so will Bliss's socially and politically prominent family, the Browns. Benni isn't certain how to react when Lydia Ortiz, Sam's mother and Gabe's first wife, arrives to discuss the domestic crisis. Matters come to a head when the extended families dine together at the Browns' ancestral stronghold, Seven Sisters Ranch. The murder of Giles Norton, husband of another Brown offshoot and the son of prominent vintners, puts everyone at Seven Sisters at risk. A sheriff's department newcomer, Ford "Hud" Hudson, investigates the killing, and quickly pegs Benni as an unofficial assistant because of her reputation for nosiness and her connections to the case. The tenacious Hud constantly backs Benni into corners whenever she shows signs of wanting to wash her hands of the whole affair. In the end, Benni's own instincts drive her to dig out the long-hidden truth behind the deaths of four of the original seven Brown sisters, for whom the ranch was named. How this secret relates to the present tragedy provides the stunning climax to a compelling story of families torn apart by divided loyalties. Agent, Deborah Schneider. 9-city author tour.

Casteneda, here represented by a compilation of quotes from his major works, is of course ever-popular.

He picked his way through the trash along the wall to a nearby street, walked quickly to the next turning, went left, then right. The street widened a little; the people he passed wore warmer clothes. He ducked into an alcove and pulled off the ragged jacket that had concealed his own unpatched shirt and tunic, folded the ragged one into a tidy bundle, and tucked it under his arm. Now he moved at a steady jog into the wealthier part of the city, nearer the palace. Finally he turned in to a gap between buildings, found the trapdoor he sought, and went belowground again.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In the cellar of a tall house within a few minutes of the palace gates, he gave a coded knock. A hard-faced man with a spiked billet opened the door. "What d'you want, rat?" the man asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"For Duke Verrakai's hand only," the boy said. "From the Horned Chain."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"I'll take him," another man said, stepping out of looming shadows. He wore the red and black of Liart, and the horned chain was about his neck. "Come, boy."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Shaking with fear, the boy followed, up stairs and along a corridor, to a room where another man, in Verrakai blue and silver, sat writing at a table by a fire. &nbsp; "I am Duke Verrakai. You have a message for me: give it."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The boy seemed to choke, and then, in a deep voice not his own, spoke the words Liart's priest had bade him say. "The man is free, and his companions; the paladin is ours. Without her aid, he can be taken. He must not reach Lyonya alive."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"He will not," Duke Verrakai said. "Is there more?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The boy dug into his tunic and pulled out a folded paper; Verrakai took it and read it. "Well," he said, with a glance at the man in red and black. "It seems we must return this boy with our answer." He wrote on the reverse of the message, folded it, and handed it to the boy. "Go the way you came, swiftly."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Less than a half-glass later, a man in Verrakai blue rode out the south gates of Verella and turned east on the river road. Later, after the turn of night, Kieri Phelan, newly revealed king of Lyonya, also rode through the gates, with an escort of the Royal Guard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Duke's Stronghold, North Marches, seven days later&nbsp;<br><br>Jandelir Arcolin, senior captain of Duke Phelan's Company, rested his forearms on the top of the stronghold walls, where he had the best view to the south. On one side of the road to Duke's East, Stammel was putting his own cohort through an intricate marching drill. On the other, the junior sergeant of the recruit cohort supervised a sword drill with wooden blades. Beyond, the trees along the stream showed the first soft golds and oranges of ripening buds, though it would be hands of days yet before the fruit trees bloomed. Old snow still lay knee-deep against the north wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>He heard steps behind him, and turned. Cracolnya, captain of the mixed cohort, came up onto the walkway with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Are you putting down roots up here?" he asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Arcolin shook his head. "Hoping for a courier. We should have heard something by now. At least the weather's lifted. Though not for long." He tipped his head to the northwest, where a line of dark clouds just showed over the hills.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Your worry won't bring the Duke faster," Cracolnya said. He turned his back on the view south and leaned against the parapet. "I wonder what we'll do this year." &nbsp; "I don't know." Arcolin glanced down at the courtyard below, to be sure their inquisitive visitors, merchant-agents from Vonja, weren't in earshot. "He said not to take any contracts until he got back; I suggested they go to Verella and talk to him, but they were afraid of missing him on the way."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"What are they offering?"&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"A one-cohort contract to protect farmlands and roads from brigands. I told them we'd need two for that--"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"At least. Better the whole Company, or you're without reliable archery. Or were they planning to assign their militia to help?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"No. From what they said, they disbanded half the militia. Trade's down. But what do you think the Council will say? With the trouble this past winter, the Duke can't say it's entirely safe here. Yet--we have to do something. This land won't support so many soldiers year-round."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Cracolnya leaned over the parapet, watching the recruit cohort. "We've got to do something with those recruits, too. They signed up to fight, and all we've done with them is train . . . and he's taken their final oaths: they'll be due regular pay soon."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"He'll think of something." Arcolin looked again at the line of clouds along the western horizon. Buds or no buds, another winter storm was coming. "He always does. But if he doesn't come soon, we won't get the good quarters in Valdaire." He looked south again, sighing, then stiffened. "Someone's coming!"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>A single horseman, carrying the Company pennant, moving fast on the road from Duke's East. Not the Duke, who would have an escort.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Should I announce it, sir?" the sentry asked. &nbsp; "No. It's just a messenger." Unfortunately. They needed the Duke. Arcolin turned and made his way down to the courtyard with Cracolnya at his heels.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"I'll tell the stable," Cracolnya said, turning away. Arcolin moved to the gate, where he could watch the messenger approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Whatever the message might be, it was urgent enough for the rider to keep his mount at a steady canter, trotting only the last few yards to the gate and then halting his mount to salute the sentry before riding in. Arcolin recognized Sef, a private in Dorrin's cohort.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Captain," Sef said, after he dismounted and handed the reins to one of the recruits on stable duty. "I have urgent news."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Into the barracks," Arcolin said. Through the opening to the Duke's courtyard, he could see the two merchants hurrying toward them, but merchants were not allowed in the barracks. He led the way, and turned in to the little room where the sergeants kept the cohort records and brewed sib on their own hearth. "What is it? Is the Duke coming? How far behind you is he?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"No sir, he's not coming, and you won't believe--but I should give you this first." Sef took a message tube from his tunic and handed it over.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Arcolin glanced at the hearth. "See if there's any sib left, or brew yourself some; you've had a long ride. And if I know Stammel, he's got a roll hidden away somewhere."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Thank you, sir." Sef turned to the hearth, stirred the fire, and dipped a can of water from the barrel, setting it to heat.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Arcolin unrolled the message. A smaller wrapped packet fell out; he put it aside. There, in the Duke's hand--with a postscript by Dorrin, he saw at a glance--he found what he had never imagined. Kieri Phelan revealed as the rightful king of Lyonya--Paksenarrion had discovered it, come to Tsaia to find him--Tammarion's sword had been his sword all along, elf-made for him, and it had declared him. Arcolin glanced at Sef, who was stirring roots and herbs into the can. "Did you see this yourself? Were you in Verella with the Duke?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"No, Captain. I was with the reserve troop. Captain Selfer come up from Verella, him and the horse both near knackered, and said the best rider must go fast as could be to the stronghold." Sef swallowed. "He thought it would be only two days, maybe, but that fog came in. I couldn't go more than a foot pace, mostly leading the horse. It's taken me twice as long as it should have, three days and this morning."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"I'm not surprised," Arcolin said. "We had thick fog for days, up here; you did well, Sef." He read on, while Sef stirred the can of sib, struggling to make sense of what had happened. His mind snagged on Paksenarrion--once in his cohort. I must go, and leave her in torment, Kieri had written. Otherwise her torment is meaningless. Yet it is a stain on my honor. You will rule in my stead until the Regency Council confirms a new lord. I recommended you, but do not know what they will do. This letter and my signet ring will prove your identity and authority. &nbsp; Arcolin unwrapped the smaller packet and found the Duke's ring. Not one of the copies he lent to his captains on occasion to do business for him, but the original, the one he himself wore.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Dorrin's postscript was brief. She was going with Kieri, on his orders; her cohort would follow. She feared more attacks on the Duke--scratched out to read King--on the road east. She did not know when she might return; it would depend upon his need.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Arcolin rolled the pages and slid them back into the tube. "Well. You will have traveled ahead of any word of his passage to the east--" He tried to estimate where Kieri might be, where Dorrin might be, seven days on a road he himself had never traveled. Impossible.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Right, Captain." Sef stirred the can again, sniffed it. "Want some sib, sir?" &nbsp; "No thanks. Go ahead."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Sef took a mug down from the rack and poured one for himself as he talked. "Captain Selfer said Captain Dorrin expected his cohort to catch up with the Duke before the Lyonya border. Wish I was with them--" He took a swallow of hot sib.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; "I'm--I must admit I'm shocked . . . amazed . . . I don't know what to think," Arcolin said. "Our Duke a king--all the rest--" Remembering Paks as a recruit, a novice . . . the steady, reliable soldier she'd become . . . why she left, and when . . . the rumors . . . and then her return. He squeezed his eyes hard against tears, at the thought of her in Liart's hands, shook his head, and looked again at Sef. "You've done very well, Sef. Go tell the cooks to give you a hot meal, and I'll get Stammel to find you a place to sleep undisturbed."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Sef saluted, then carefully rinsed the can and set it to dry before going out. Arcolin followed him, wondering if he'd have to explain to the Vonja agents before he found Stammel. Instead, Stammel met him at the gate. Arcolin smiled.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Your good instincts again, Sergeant."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"My insatiable curiosity, Captain. News from the Duke could always be marching orders."<br><br>&nbsp; "It's strange news indeed, and I'm not sure what will happen now," Arcolin said. "The courier was Sef of Dorrin's cohort--he needs a quiet bed to sleep; he was three days in thick fog between here and the south border. I sent him to the mess hall."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"I'll see to it, Captain."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"I need to talk to the other captains before I spread the news," Arcolin said. "I can tell you this--nothing will be the same."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; "It never is," Stammel said. "That's why we like it. Your leave, Captain." &nbsp; "Go ahead," Arcolin said, thinking again how lucky he was to have Stammel as senior sergeant.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; He found Cracolnya in the stables, talking fodder with the quartermaster.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; "And I don't know where more hay's coming from, this time of year," the quartermaster said. "Nobody's got enough stored; it's not to be bought, not at any price, and I know the Duke wouldn't want us to take from the farmers' stock." &nbsp; Arcolin made a motion with his head, and Cracolnya nodded. To the quartermaster he said, "A messenger's come from the Duke; maybe an order to move out--that would help."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; "I hope so," the quartermaster said gloomily. He spat into a corner. "I can't be sure . . ."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Arcolin led the way down the aisle between rows of tie stalls to the box stalls at the end, empty now but for his and Cracolnya's mounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"What is it? You look--strange."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"I should. You must read it yourself." He handed over the message tube; Cracolnya opened it, unrolled the message, and started to read. Arcolin's roan ambler moved up to the front of the stall and nudged him; he rubbed the velvety muzzle absently while watching Cracolnya's face.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"I--I don't know what to think," Cracolnya said, when he'd finished. "He's a king? In Lyonya? How did that happen?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"I don't know more than this."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"They have a king already," Cracolnya said. "What's he think about it?"&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; "You missed a bit," Arcolin said. "He stuck it in between lines. Their king died without an heir. Paks was there--that's where she went when she left here. She felt called to find the heir." He ran a hand over his head. "But--what do we do now? He wants troops out guarding the Pargunese border; he thinks they might use this as an excuse to attack."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Scouts haven't said anything."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"No. And this about a contract. You know what he said before he went south; he expected to take the Company south. But only one cohort?" He shook his head. "You know the Vonjans. They'll want twice the work for half the pay."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"One cohort out, with pack mules, would ease the fodder situation," Cracolnya said. "Two would be better, if you can talk them into it."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"What about protection here, though?" Arcolin said. "He's worried about the Pargunese, and the south border. A cohort each way, plus mine in the south, will nearly empty the stronghold. And we'll have to use the recruits, until Dorrin comes back." However long that might be.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Cracolnya shrugged. "This recruit cohort's the best-trained we've ever had. They can garrison this; I can split mine between east and south. Or, the recruits can do their first real route march and take the southern end--we haven't had trouble with either of the neighboring domains, barring the odd thief, since Count Halar's father died."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"That's a good idea, about using the recruits to garrison down there if needed," Arcolin said. "But first, I need to tell the Company about the Duke."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Maybe we should wait until we hear from Chaya," Cracolnya said. "Just in case." &nbsp; "In case--"&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"He was attacked once. Suppose Verrakai raised a large force against him?" &nbsp; "He's got Dorrin's cohort."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"He's got Dorrin's cohort on the way, but what if they don't get there in time? He could be killed. Something could go wrong in Lyonya."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"I don't--" Arcolin took two steps forward, turned, then took two steps back, avoiding the thought of Kieri Phelan dead. Instead, he said, "We have to tell the troops something--they have to know he's not coming back."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"He left it to you," Cracolnya said. "But if you want my advice--" Arcolin nodded. "Then," Cracolnya went on, "make us a contract, and tell the Company that, and then tell them what you've heard, that it's all we know."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Ask the quartermaster how many beasts he can feed until spring grass," Arcolin said.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Cracolnya looked smug. "I already know. Twelve."&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Arcolin looked down the rows of tie stalls, mostly full. "Better get moving, then." He left Cracolnya in the stable and headed back to the officers' quarters and offices.</p><h2>Navajo and Tibetan Sacred Wisdom: The Circle of the Spirit</h2><p>The similarity between the Navajo and Tibetan spiritual traditions has often been remarked upon by scholars chiefly because of the mandala sand paintings common to both cultures, their ideas about matter and spirit, and their uncanny physical resemblance to one another. Author Peter Gold substantiates the shared knowledge of these seemingly disparate people by drawing extensive parallels among many aspects of both cultures: creation myths, cosmology, geomancy, psychology, visionary arts, and healing and initiation rituals. Through his sensitive comparison of Navajo and Tibetan sacred ways, the author encourages us to reconsider our own cultural paradigms and shows us how we might begin to recover a sense of the sacred.</p><p>Formerly a research assistant to Dr. Margaret Mead and curator at Indiana University's anthropology and folklore museum, Peter Gold is currently on the anthropology faculty of the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco. He is also the author of <i>Tibetan Reflections: Life in a Tibetan Refugee Community; Altar of the Earth: The Life, Land, and Spirit of Tibet; and Tibetan Pilgrimage</i>."A bold and exciting exploration, showing many astonishing parallels between these precious and imperiled traditions, from which we have so much to learn.", <i>Peter Matthiessen, author of The Snow Leopard and Indian Country</i><br><br>"Peter Gold has described our ways and philosophy of life in this book and I hope that it will help you to better understand us.

In our long talk, we found many similarities between Navajo and Tibetan philosophy and sacred ways.

As an anthropologist, I am impressed by Peter Goldï¿½s sustained fieldwork among two peoples, so far apart in space, language, history.

But as acclaimed historian Sarah Gristwood reveals, while the events of this turbulent time are usually described in terms of the men who fought and died seeking the throne, a handful of powerful women would prove just as decisive as their kinfolks' clashing armies.

Ben Malcom coordinated the intelligence activities of eleven partisan battalions, including the famous White Tigers. With Malcom&#x2019;s experiences as its focus, <i>White Tigers</i> examines all aspects of guerrilla activities in Korea. This exciting memoir makes an important contribution to the history of special operations.</p><p>Ron Martz writes on defense issues for the <i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i>. His books include <i>Solitary Survivor: The First American POW in Southeast Asia</i> (with Lawrence R. Bailey, Jr.; Brassey&#x2019;s, Inc., 1995) and <i>White Tigers: My Secret War in North Korea</i> (with Ben Malcom; Brassey&#x2019;s, Inc., 1996), which <i>Publishers Weekly</i> praised as "exciting reading." He lives in Roswell, Georgia.This is the untold story of the U.S. Army's role in unconventional warfare in the Korean War. An army first lieutenant, Malcom was handpicked to go behind enemy lines to recruit, train and lead North Korean partisans in their war against Chinese and North Korean forces. He recounts how he won the guerrillas' trust and, with a minimum of support from Far East Command, mounted a series of operations that combined sabotage with intelligence-gathering. (His 4th Partisan Infantry Battalion provided the framework for establishing the Army's Special Forces in 1952.) His account of the raids behind enemy lines makes for exciting reading, and he pays moving tribute to the Koreans' extraordinary stamina, seeming indifference to pain and chivalric code of conduct. But the most eloquent passages revolve around his complaint that the institutional knowledge he acquired during the war was ignored in Vietnam, where U.S. military advisers had to learn the hard lessons of guerrilla warfare on their own. Malcom served as a battalion commander in Vietnam; Martz coauthored Solitary Survivor. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sugar Skull</h2><p>The long, strange trip that began in <i>X'ed Out</i> and continued in <i>The Hive</i> reaches its mind-bending, heartbreaking end, but not before Doug is forced to deal with the lie he's been telling himself since the beginning.

The village was afflicted with smallpox. Worse, it was the wrong encampment. Intended as a retaliation against Mountain Chief&#x2019;s renegade band, the massacre sparked public outrage when news sources revealed that the battalion had attacked Heavy Runner&#x2019;s innocent village&#x2014;and that guides had told its inebriated commander, Major Eugene Baker, he was on the wrong trail, but he struck anyway. Remembered as one of the most heinous incidents of the Indian Wars, the Baker Massacre has often been overshadowed by the better-known Battle of the Little Bighorn and has never received full treatment until now.<br><br> Author Paul R. Wylie plumbs the history of Euro-American involvement with the Piegans, who were members of the Blackfeet Confederacy. His research shows the tribe was trading furs for whiskey with the Hudson&#x2019;s Bay Company before Meriwether Lewis encountered them in 1806. As American fur traders and trappers moved into the region, the U.S. government soon followed, making treaties it did not honor. When the gold rush started in the 1860s and the U.S. Army arrived, pressure from Montana citizens to control the Piegans and make the territory safe led Generals William Tecumseh Sherman and Philip H. Sheridan to send Baker and the 2nd Cavalry, with tragic consequences. Although these generals sought to dictate press coverage thereafter, news of the cruelty of the killings appeared in the <i>New York Times,</i> which called the massacre &#x201c;a more shocking affair than the sacking of Black Kettle&#x2019;s camp on the Washita&#x201d; two years earlier.<br><br> While other scholars have written about the Baker Massacre in related contexts, <i>Blood on the Marias </i>gives this infamous event the definitive treatment it deserves. Baker&#x2019;s inept command lit the spark of violence, but decades of tension between Piegans and whites set the stage for a brutal and too-often-forgotten incident.</p><p><p><b>Paul R. Wylie,</b> a retired attorney and now an independent researcher and writer, is author of <i>The Irish General: Thomas Francis Meagher. </i>He lives in Bozeman, Montana.</p>&#x201c;Major Eugene M. Baker&#x2019;s brutal attack on an innocent village of Piegan Indians was another of those appalling bloodlettings in western American Indian history. Baker&#x2019;s destruction of the Marias River encampment in northern Montana in 1870 was of the same ilk as the brutality waged earlier at Sand Creek and Bear River and later at Wounded Knee. Dare we forget any of them and dare we not tell these stories straight. Here Paul Wylie takes on this difficult story in a smartly written, exhaustively researched account that begins in the earliest days of Piegan contact with whites and carries through their darkest hour. It&#x2019;s a tough tale, rightly well told.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Paul L. Hedren, </b>author of <i>After Custer: Loss and Transformation in Sioux Country</i><br><br>&#x201c;Paul Wylie&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Blood on the Marias</i>&nbsp;is nothing less than compelling. The writing is clear and imaginative, the research exhaustive, and the drama sinister and electric. Embedded in the melancholy story of Blackfeet-American relationships, the 1870 disaster of the Baker Massacre should, thanks to Paul Wylie, never again be forgotten or even thought obscure. It remains too sad and too close.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>William E.

In <i>Would You Baptize an Extraterrestrial? </i>they<i> </i>explore a variety of questions at the crossroads of faith and reason: How do you reconcile the The Big Bang with Genesis? Was the Star of Bethlehem just a pious religious story or an actual description of astronomical events? What really went down between Galileo and the Catholic Church&#x2014;and why do the effects of that confrontation still reverberate to this day?&nbsp;Will the Universe come to an end? And... could you really baptize an extraterrestrial?<br><br>With disarming humor, Brother Guy and Father Paul explore these questions and more over the course of six days of dialogue. <i>Would You Baptize an Extraterrestrial</i> will make you laugh, make you think, and make you reflect more deeply on science, faith, and the nature of the universe.</p></p><p><b>BROTHER GUY CONSOLMAGNO, SJ</b> was born in Detroit, Michigan, earned undergraduate and masters' degrees in Earth and Planetary Sciences from MIT (in 1974 and 1975), and a Ph. D. in Planetary Science from the University of Arizona in 1978. He worked as a post-doctoral fellow and lecturer at Harvard University's Department of Astronomy, and MIT's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences; served in the US Peace Corps, teaching physics at the University of Nairobi; and was a physics professor at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, before entering the Jesuits as a brother in 1989. At the Vatican Observatory since 1993, his research explores connections between meteorites, asteroids, and the evolution of small solar system bodies. <br><br><b>FATHER PAUL R. MUELLER, SJ</b> is a native of Cincinnati, Ohio. He attended a Jesuit high school and earned a degree in physics at Boston University before entering the Society of Jesus in 1982. As part of his Jesuit training, he earned masters degrees in both philosophy and theology, along the way developing an interest in religion-science issues. After being ordained a priest in 1993, he attended the University of Chicago, where he completed a third masters degree (in physics) and a doctorate in the history and philosophy of science through the interdisciplinary program in Conceptual Historical Studies of Science.Day 1: Biblical Genesis or Scientific Big Bang?<br><br>Setting: The Art Institute of Chicago<br>Gallery of the Early Twentieth Century<br><br>Paul: Today we&#x2019;re going to talk about the beginning of all things, Creation itself. So it&#x2019;s fitting that we&#x2019;re in Chicago, since each of us had a kind of personal beginning here in the Windy City. You did philosophy studies at Loyola University shortly after you became a Jesuit. And I earned my doctorate in the history and philosophy of science at the University of Chicago.<br><br>Guy: When I read the opening verses of Genesis, where &#x201c;a wind from God swept over the face of the waters,&#x201d; I always picture myself standing by the shore of a stormy Lake Huron; that&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;m from. But, ah, Lake Michigan and the Windy City . . . It&#x2019;s tough for this Detroiter to admit it, but I love Chicago. And this area, the Museum Campus down by the lakeshore, is like heaven to me. So many favorite places of mine: the Adler Planetarium; the Shedd Aquarium . . . <br><br>But if we&#x2019;re going to talk about the beginning of the universe, why are we at the Art Institute? Shouldn&#x2019;t we be at the planetarium, where we could watch a show that illustrates the Big Bang on its giant dome? Or maybe we should be at the Field Museum of Natural History, with its wonderful collection of dinosaur fossils and meteorites.<br><br>Paul: Think of all those people who are always asking us, as Vatican astronomers, about science and religion and the beginning of the universe . . . <br><br>Guy: The ones who want us to choose between Genesis and the Big Bang?<br><br>Paul: Yes. Most of them aren&#x2019;t scientists, so I don&#x2019;t think that addressing their questions in a scientific place--a planetarium, for instance--would be all that helpful.<br><br>So often we divide our lives up into separate camps, separate buildings, if you will: aquarium versus planetarium, work versus play, science versus religion, and so forth. Sometimes it&#x2019;s hard to move from one to the other. I want us to start out today in a place where science and religion can overlap. Here at the Art Institute, you can&#x2019;t help but see that there&#x2019;s more than one way to represent reality--more than one style of painting, you might say.<br><br>So humor me for a moment. Let&#x2019;s look at some of my favorite works of art.<br><br>Guy: Hmm . . . isn&#x2019;t that Grant Wood&#x2019;s American Gothic? The weather-beaten couple standing in front of a white clapboard house, the man holding a pitchfork staring directly out of the canvas, the woman giving him a dirty look . . . <br><br>Paul: The painting may be all too familiar, but I like it. Though it&#x2019;s as realistic as a photograph, it still seems to tell you something about these two people that a photo wouldn&#x2019;t be able to capture.<br><br>Now, head down this hall to the European section, and compare American Gothic with this painting . . . <br><br>Guy: Picasso&#x2019;s The Old Guitarist. I guess that&#x2019;s an old man seated with a guitar, but he&#x2019;s depicted in an almost abstract way. The guitar is painted realistically enough, but the old man is shown in weird lines and angles and a funky blue color scheme. That&#x2019;s a whole different take on the human form.<br><br>Paul: It looks more &#x201c;modern&#x201d; than American Gothic, though it was painted about thirty years earlier.<br><br>Both paintings depict old people with the tools of their trades. Both were painted at roughly the same time, in the early twentieth century. Both communicate something deep and true about humanity, intellectually and emotionally, in ways that a book or a homily couldn&#x2019;t.<br><br>But neither painting tries to show everything about its subject matter. Each painting selects and emphasizes only certain things and leaves out other stuff that&#x2019;d be irrelevant or that&#x2019;d get in the way. And you know what? Science does something very similar. Science involves selective observation--science involves paying special attention to certain things while ignoring others.<br><br>Guy: Like a painting I remember seeing once, of a couple of people sitting in a city diner: a guy with a hawk nose and a woman in red sitting next to him, as seen through the diner window from across the street late at night. You could never take a photograph like that; there&#x2019;d be parked cars and telephone wires in the way. But every time I see that painting, I get hungry for some fried eggs and coffee.<br><br>Paul: Edward Hopper&#x2019;s Nighthawks. That one is also here at the Art Institute, over in Special Exhibitions.<br><br>Guy: I always thought of you as a physicist-turned-philosopher. I didn&#x2019;t know you were such an art nerd.<br><br>Paul: I&#x2019;m no art expert, believe me. But get this: back when I was in college (too many years ago), I once spent ninety minutes standing in front of a painting at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, in Boston, taking notes on a yellow legal pad. It was an assignment I had to do for a course in art history. The painting was Titian&#x2019;s Rape of Europa: Jupiter, in the form of a white bull, is carrying Princess Europa away across the sea, where he will have his way with her. As I stood there taking notes, other museum visitors started asking me questions about the painting, as though I were some kind of expert! At first I laughed it off. But after a while I started talking with people about the painting, telling them what I had noticed about it and what I thought of it. And they told me what they thought. It led to some spirited discussions and disagreements as to what the painting means, as to whether or not it is beautiful, and why.<br><br>So it&#x2019;s not only art experts who can recognize and talk meaningfully about what&#x2019;s beautiful. It&#x2019;s not only scientists who can recognize what&#x2019;s true. And it&#x2019;s not only ethicists who can recognize what&#x2019;s good. Of course, experts can help and guide us. But things that are really beautiful or true or good can be recognized and appreciated by regular folks--if we are willing to open our eyes and take some time.<br><br>Guy: So, Mr. Art Expert, where do we go next?<br>Late Nineteenth Century: Impressionism<br><br>PAUL: A Sunday on La Grande Jatte--1884; it&#x2019;s one of my favorites. Georges Seurat painted a scene with elegant French families in a Parisian park on an island in the Seine River, circa 1884. He used a technique called pointillism: instead of strokes of paint, he built up the image by adding colors dot by dot . . . anticipating digital-imaging techniques by over a hundred years.<br><br>Guy: I hate to admit this . . . but when I see this painting, the first thing I think of is Ferris Bueller&#x2019;s Day Off.<br><br>Paul: Oh, yeah, the movie with Matthew Broderick! This painting is the centerpiece of a pivotal scene in the movie. A trio of high school kids play hooky, and they have various improbable adventures around Chicago on a nice spring day. When they come here to the Art Institute, one of them, an angst-ridden teenager named Cameron, stares for a long time at A Sunday on La Grande Jatte--1884. As he gazes more and more deeply into the painting, with a stricken look on his face, the Parisian scene disappears from view: it falls apart into a chaotic, random collection of colored dots. It&#x2019;s at that moment that Cameron realizes that his own life seems to be falling apart into meaningless bits and pieces.<br><br>I have a certain sympathy for Cameron; I had my own share of teenage angst! But what I see when I look at Seurat&#x2019;s painting isn&#x2019;t chaos. I don&#x2019;t see the world falling apart. What I see is the world being analyzed down to its smallest, most basic parts.<br><br>When I look at A Sunday on La Grande Jatte--1884, I keep flipping back and forth between seeing the whole scene, which is lots of people enjoying a beautiful day in the park, and seeing the little dots from which that scene is made up. But to me that doesn&#x2019;t mean the world is falling apart--it means that there is more than one way to see the world. One way is to see the big picture, the everyday world of common experience. Another way is to see the world as analyzed by science: a world of tiny atoms, of particles and waves, of fields of force--a world that can be described mathematically.<br><br>That&#x2019;s one way to get at relating science and faith: think of it as flipping back and forth between two different ways of seeing one and the same world. We can see the world through the eyes of science or through the eyes of faith.<br><br>When you see the world through the eyes of faith, you are often very much concerned with everyday experiences of what is right and good and beautiful. You are concerned with how your life hangs together and makes sense--or doesn&#x2019;t!<br><br>But when you see the world through the eyes of science, your concerns are different. You want to know how the world works and what it&#x2019;s made of, right down to its smallest pieces. The world as analyzed by science can seem disconnected from the world of everyday experience, just as the dots in Seurat&#x2019;s painting can seem disconnected from the larger image.<br><br>The trick is to get comfortable with the idea of flipping back and forth between two different ways of seeing. And the trick, also, is not to panic if one way of seeing omits something that the other includes, or emphasizes something that the other neglects.<br><br>Guy: So you can see this painting as a collection of dots, or you can see it as an image of people in a park. Both descriptions are true. If one of them is true, it doesn&#x2019;t make the other one false.<br><br>Paul: Just like you, Guy, I had to study some philosophy, as part of my Jesuit training. It drove me crazy. I was a science guy, and I just couldn&#x2019;t figure out what it was that the philosophers were worried about. It wasn&#x2019;t that I couldn&#x2019;t understand their answers. I couldn&#x2019;t even understand their questions!<br><br>Finally, after a year and a half of frustration, I had a kind of breakthrough. One day I was puzzling over Aristotle and his theory that each thing should be understood as being a composite of &#x201c;matter&#x201d; and &#x201c;form.&#x201d; Now, I thought I knew what &#x201c;matter&#x201d; was, from my study of physics: it&#x2019;s what stuff is made of. But I couldn&#x2019;t figure out why, in addition to matter, you would need something else called &#x201c;form.&#x201d;<br><br>Then suddenly it hit me, like a ton of bricks . . . I was making an assumption: that knowing what something is means breaking it down to its smallest parts (atoms, quarks, whatever) and figuring out the physical laws governing how they interact. But Aristotle doesn&#x2019;t make that assumption. For him, breaking a thing down to its smallest parts is only one part of what it means to know it. For Aristotle, to really know something, you have to see not just its parts but also the whole.<br><br>Guy: So not just the dots, but also the picture that the dots make?<br><br>Paul: Even more than that. For Aristotle, really understanding a thing means knowing what it&#x2019;s made of, what kind of thing it is, who made it, and why they made it--what&#x2019;s its value or meaning. For Aristotle, questions like that come up as part of doing science.<br><br>But in modern science, the questions are much narrower. Questions about the value or meaning or purpose of things don&#x2019;t come up in modern science--they are set aside. As a result, modern science has become much more focused and efficient: we can analyze and describe all sorts of things we see in nature in terms of objective, mathematical laws. But the fact that questions about value or meaning or purpose don&#x2019;t come up in modern science doesn&#x2019;t mean that those questions aren&#x2019;t important.<br><br>That&#x2019;s the kicker--that&#x2019;s what hit me, back when I was first studying Aristotle. As a human being, I may want to know who made a thing and why. I may want to know about the value and meaning of a thing, even if science considers such questions irrelevant.<br><br>Modern science is incredibly successful at doing what it does, from understanding how to control diseases to calculating what happens around a black hole. This can lead us to make the lazy assumption that the scientific way of seeing the world is the best way, or even the only legitimate way. That&#x2019;s the assumption I had fallen into while studying physics in college. But if you think that seeing the world through the eyes of science will show us everything that really matters, then you might as well think that you see everything that matters about A Sunday on La Grande Jatte--1884 if you look at it dot-by-dot.<br><br>Guy: OK, I can see that. &#x201c;Flipping back and forth&#x201d; is a useful image to keep in mind whenever we get asked, &#x201c;If you believe that God speaks to us through Scripture, then why don&#x2019;t you accept the story of Creation given to us in the Bible?&#x201d; Maybe the people who ask us that aren&#x2019;t getting that there&#x2019;s more than one way to look at the picture. And so they end up wanting to treat the Bible like an astronomy textbook.<br><br>And the fact is, there&#x2019;s more than one way of looking at the picture even within the Bible itself. The Bible contains several different Creation stories. It just isn&#x2019;t possible for all of them to be literally true--they disagree with one another! So there has to be something else going on here. Since they can&#x2019;t all be true in the same way, that means you need to be able to develop some way to flip back and forth between different descriptions even within the Bible itself.<br><br>Paul: But let&#x2019;s be careful here. We don&#x2019;t want to fall into the easy trap of saying, &#x201c;Everything is relative; everything is true.&#x201d;<br><br>Earlier I was telling you about standing in front of a painting, arguing with passersby about what it meant and whether it was beautiful, and why or why not. It makes sense to have that kind of argument about the beauty of a painting, even a classic like The Rape of Europa. But it wouldn&#x2019;t make sense to have a similar argument about the truth of a classic law of science, like the law of pendulum motion.<br><br>Guy: Obviously, denying the truth of the law of the pendulum just makes you look silly. But are you saying that everyone, expert or not, has a right to accept or deny that a piece of art is beautiful?<br><br>Paul: When it comes to things like pendulums, pulleys, and electric motors, the science is settled--not because some pointy-headed scientific expert tells us so, but because these things are tools that we rely upon and use every day and take for granted. But when it comes to questions of meaning and beauty, it&#x2019;s different. Those aren&#x2019;t questions that get &#x201c;settled&#x201d;; those are things that each generation has to appropriate for itself, building on what came before.</p><h2>The Original Scots Colonists of Early America, 1612-1783</h2><p>About 150,000 Scots emigrated to America before the Revolutionary War, but the records on them are notoriously hard to find. However, it has been clear for some time that in archives in Scotland and England there is much information on a number of these emigrants. David Dobson has extracted data from a wide variety of sources including family and estate papers, testamentary and probate records, burgh muniments, sasine and deed registers, Sheriff&#39;s Court records, Court of Session and High Court of Judiciary records, port books, customs registers, contemporary diaries and journals, contemporary newspapers and magazines, professional and university records, Privy Council and colonial records, records of Episcopalian and Presbyterian churches, monumental inscription lists, and the 1774-75 Register of Emigrants. For each of the 7,000 persons listed, a maximum of twenty-three points of information is provided: name, date of birth or baptism, place of birth, occupation, place of education, cause of banishment (where applicable), residence, parents&#39; names, emigration date and whether voluntarily or involuntarily transported, port of embarkation, destination, name of ship, place and date of arrival, place of settlement, names of spouse and children, date and place of death, where buried, probate record, and source citation.</p><p></p><h2>3 Sections: Poems</h2><p><p><b>The winner of the 2014 Pulitzer Prize in Poetry, now in paperback</b><br><b></b><i></i><br><i>First I had three</i> </p><p><i>apocalyptic visions, each more terrible than the last.</i> <i>The graves open, and the sea rises to kill us all.</i><br><i>Then the doorbell rang, and I went downstairs and signed for two packages&#x2015;</i><br>&#x2015;from "This Morning"</p><p>In an array of poetic forms from the rhyming lyric to the philosophical meditation to the prose essay, <i>3 Sections</i> confronts perplexing divisions of contemporary life&#x2015;a wayward history, an indeterminate future, and a perpetual longing to out-think time.

Namely, looking hard at things and situations, long sentences constructed of numerous clauses, lines of irregular length, many poems alike in appearance and style, and irony dripping like poison. A few of the poems do not survive the infusion, reading as precious instead of delicate. There is a marvelous prose interlude, &#x201c;Pacific Fishes of Canada,&#x201d; about a misguided but nonetheless formative adventure on a trawler in the Bering Sea. If the whole book were this pure and anguished, this would be an indispensable collection. The narrative poem &#x201c;Personal Essay&#x201d; is the longest piece in the book. In it, Seshadri, winner of the James Laughlin Award, risks everything, but cuts perilously close to mere effect. He is so talented, so able, and writes with such panache, Seshadri is in danger of a weakness few contemporary poets even approach. --Michael Autrey</p><h2>The Distant Land of My Father</h2><p>Anna, the narrator of this riveting novel, lives in a storybook world: exotic pre-World War II Shanghai, with handsome young parents, wealth, and comfort. Her father, the son of missionaries, leads a charmed and secretive life, though his greatest joy is sharing his beloved city with his only daughter. Yet when Anna and her mother flee Japanese-occupied Shanghai to return to California, he stays behind, believing his connections and a little bit of luck will keep him safe.<br><br> Through Anna's memories and her father's journals we learn of his fall from charismatic millionaire to tortured prisoner, in a story of betrayal and reconciliation that spans two continents. <i>The Distant Land of My Father</i>, a breathtaking and richly lyrical debut, unfolds to reveal an enduring family love through tragic circumstances.<br><br> National Bestseller</p><p><i>The Distant Land of My Father</i> begins like a fairy tale: "My father was a millionaire in Shanghai in the 1930s.... On the day he was born, in the province of Shantung, neighbors presented my missionary grandparents, the only Americans for miles, with noodles in great abundance and one hundred chicken eggs, in honor of their son's birth." To the young Anna Schoene, life in Shanghai is indeed magical. There are servants, a luxurious villa, a beautiful mother who smells like Chanel No. 5, and a young, handsome, polo-playing father. Unfortunately, her father is also a smuggler and speculator who loves his freewheeling life more than anything (or anyone) else. Despite warnings, Schoene refuses to leave Shanghai even after the Japanese invade, and his wife and child retreat to Los Angeles; later, he survives imprisonment and torture only to once again choose Shanghai over his family--this time with the Communists moving in.<p> Bo Caldwell's sepia-toned evocation of 1930s Shanghai is lovely and physical, and given the built-in drama of its setting, this first novel ought to have the vividness of a classic movie. Yet the characters remain oddly flat while world events swirl around them. Great chunks of historical exposition seem largely undigested, while Schoene's final change of heart fails to ring true. In a sense, however, these shortcomings are beside the point. <i>The Distant Land of My Father</i> is above all a tragic romance, albeit one with an unusual love interest. Schoene is so besotted with Shanghai that his wife and daughter are scarcely as real to him as the city itself. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>Bo Caldwell has published short stories in numerous literary magazines.

For centuries, Antarctica has captured the imagination of our greatest scientists and explorers, lingering in the spirit long after their return. Shackleton called it "the last great journey"; for Apsley Cherry-Garrard it was the worst journey in the world. <br><br>This is a book about the call of the wild and the response of the spirit to a country that exists perhaps most vividly in the mind. Sara Wheeler spent seven months in Antarctica, living with its scientists and dreamers. No book is more true to the spirit of that continent--beguiling, enchanted and vast beyond the furthest reaches of our imagination. Chosen by Beryl Bainbridge and John Major as one of the best books of the year, recommended by the editors of Entertainment Weekly and the Chicago Tribune, one of the Seattle Times's top ten travel books of the year, <b>Terra Incognita</b> is a classic of polar literature.</p><p>When explorers such as Ernest Shackleton, Roald Amundsen, and Robert Falcon Scott all set off to Antarctica in the early years of the 20th century, the polar regions were among the last truly unexplored areas of the world--and arguably the least hospitable. Scott lost his life, pinned down in a howling blizzard only 11 miles from his supply depot; Shackleton lost his ship, crushed in the ice. Even those who survived the icy wastes did so only with enormous effort. And yet, there is something about Antarctica that beckons people; eighty years after Shackleton's voyage, Sara Wheeler answered the call, leaving her comfortable home for "the Great White." <i>Terra Incognita</i> is the result of her sojourn in that legendary land. <p> In addition to chronicling her own encounters with the people and the place, Wheeler brings the past alive as well, through vivid stories about the heroes of polar exploration: Shackleton, Scott, Amundsen, and others who practically become secondary characters in Wheeler's account. But it is her interactions with the living people who make up the community--scientists, drifters, and dreamers who have settled this forbidding landscape--that make <i>Terra Incognita</i> a rare and worthy book.</p>"A triumph . . . I cannot believe that anything better will ever be written about Antarctica." --Daily Telegraph<p>"Compelling . . . leaves the reader with a visceral understanding of the mysterious, even sublime power the poles have exerted<br>on the human imagination, and the desolate beauty that resides there amid the glaciers and icebergs and penguins."<br>--Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times</p><p>"I have read many accounts of polar exploration, but never one which so touchingly describes its emotional topography. . . .

Colorful sketches of lockers, teachers, students, and the mazelike building are just some of the visual details that readers will scrutinize as Amelia encounters intimidating eighth graders and faces the question of where to sit in the cafeteria. Worst of all, her English teacher, Mr. Lambaste, hates her. Big sister Cleo confesses that she had played a mean trick on Mr. Lambaste and now Amelia's attempt at being nice to him lands her in detention. As her other classes encourage her to look at art and science differently, she also learns to look at life and people differently. When she finally writes Mr. Lambaste a story about getting to know people and seeing them for who they are inside, Amelia realizes she has found a way to see through the personas of the cool kids and has taught her teacher something as well. Readers who have just started middle school will relate to and sympathize with Amelia; younger students will feel as if they are getting the inside scoop on what to expect when they get there.<i>&#x2013;Kristine M.

Six months later, a female skeleton was found on a wooded lakeshore in a neighboring county. The bones were consistent with those of the missing woman, and one of Patterson's daughters recognized a ring found at the death scene as her mother's. The bones were buried, and six years later, a relative of Patterson's&#x2014;one of the men she was last seen alive with&#x2014;confessed to killing her. Case closed.</p><p>But the tentative identification&#x2014;made years before DNA testing was available to confirm it&#x2014;failed to convince some of Patterson's relatives. And so it was that in 2005 Dr. Bass found himself winding around hairpin curves to the mountainside grave, where he would unearth the disputed remains and collect DNA samples. The forensic twists and turns that followed would test the limits of DNA technology ... and of Dr. Bass's half-century of forensic knowledge.</p></p><p><p>Jefferson Bass is the writing team of Jon Jefferson and Dr. Bill Bass.

This commentary on Acts, his magnum opus, may be the largest and most thoroughly documented Acts commentary available. Useful not only for the study of Acts but also early Christianity, this work sets Acts in its first-century context. <br><br>In this volume, the first of four, Keener introduces the book of Acts, particularly historical questions related to it, and provides detailed exegesis of its opening chapters. He utilizes an unparalleled range of ancient sources and offers a wealth of fresh insights. This magisterial commentary will be a valuable resource for New Testament professors and students, pastors, Acts scholars, and libraries.</p><p>In the first volume of this four-volume commentary, Craig Keener introduces the book of Acts and provides detailed exegesis of its opening chapters, including more than 10,000 references from extrabiblical ancient sources.<br><br>"Somewhat surprisingly, a socio-historical approach to Acts still needs to be defended and its value demonstrated. No one does this better--is more informed about ancient literature, parallels, and precedents, and more interactively and fruitfully engaged with contemporary literature and issues--than Craig Keener. In the introduction (a monograph in itself), his treatment of the genre of Acts, especially his judicious discussion of the genre 'novel,' of the character of ancient historiography, and of the historical integrity and value of Acts, is unbeatable in today's market. For anyone wanting to appreciate how Acts 'worked' in its original context and to get into the text at some depth, Keener will be indispensable and 'first off the shelf.'"<br>--<b>James D. G. Dunn</b>, University of Durham<br> <br>"Keener takes very seriously the claim of the book of Acts to be historiography.

Keener presents a socio-historical reading of the text with meticulous precision, and his knowledge of scholarly research is impressive. The documentation from ancient Jewish literature is exceptionally rich. From now on, any exegesis of Acts will need to take into account this major work."<br>--<b>Daniel Marguerat</b>, University of Lausanne, Switzerland<br><br>"Early Christianity developed in a complex and multifaceted context, one that Craig Keener masterfully presents in this socially and historically oriented commentary on Acts.

This is a commentary that will continue to serve as a detailed resource for both scholars and students."<br>--<b>Stanley E. Porter</b>, McMaster Divinity College<br><br>"A monumental exegetical commentary. . . . Scholars and readers of the Acts of the Apostles will find it a precious source for consultation.

A new philosophy is sweeping the business world, one that's more in tune with a global marketplace, where cooperation, not competition, is the key to success. <p> The Tao Te Ching is often hailed as the wisest book ever written; for more than 2,000 years it has inspired and guided people with its precepts of harmony, communication, vision, and renewal. In <em>The Tao of Personal Leadership,</em> Diane Dreher combines its ancient wisdom with lessons from successful leaders to provide a practical road map to becoming not just good managers but great leaders. Illustrating her points with examples taken from real life, she explains the basic Taoist principles readers can use to make the most of their resources, transcend conflict, transform problems, adapt to change, and enrich their business, community, and personal lives.</p></p><p>The 81 simple but profound poems of the Tao Te Ching have provided inspiration and guidance for some 2,500 years. Now, educator and consultant Diane Dreher has reinterpreted the timeless observations of Lao-tzu in an effort to give postmodern business leaders a novel yet practical road map to corporate management and personal fulfillment. The result, <i>The Tao of Personal Leadership,</i> proves the advice of the ancient Chinese philosopher is as relevant today as when it was written.It has endured because its principles are as real today as they were 25 centuries ago, for they reveal the patterns of living systems -- the flow of energy that occurs in the natural world as well as in individuals, families, relationships, institutions and nations. <p>In <i>The Tao of Personal Leadership</i>, Diane Dreher explains how, using the Tao, we can all become leaders, courageous and resourceful individuals who challenge and inspire people to fulfill their highest potential. Each of the principles in the book -- including vision, timing, respect, building community, empowerment and growth, communication, conflict resolution and harmony -- is reinforced by questions, personal exercises and examples of innovative leadership taken from real life. </p><p>With lessons that have stood the test of time, <i>The Tao of Personal Leadership</i> is a dynamic answer for facing the challenges of today's world.</p></p><h2>The King&#39;s Deryni (A Novel of the Deryni)</h2><p><i>The thrilling conclusion to </i>New York Times<i> bestselling author Katherine Kurtz&#x2019;s epic Childe Morgan trilogy.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> Alaric Morgan has one clear purpose in life&#x2014;to stand alongside the King of Gwynedd.

He had come to the Crown at fourteen, of age in law; but for a warrior-king, the true rite of passage into adulthood came only with the accolade of knighthood.</p><p>He would receive that accolade on his eighteenth birthday, conferred by both his royal uncles. Richard Haldane Duke of Carthmoor, younger half-brother of the late King Donal, was reckoned one of the most accomplished knights of his generation, and had ultimate responsibility for the training of all the young boys and adolescents who came to court to hone their warrior skills in royal service. In his hands, Brion Haldane had been but another squire as he completed his apprenticeship, wearing no crown when he bowed himself to the discipline his uncle imposed; and he had learned his lessons well.</p><p>Slated to assist Duke Richard was King Brion&#x2019;s other uncle: his mother&#x2019;s brother, Illann King of Howicce and Llannedd, come with his son and heir, Prince Ronan (himself only recently knighted), to likewise lay his royal hand on the sword that conferred this public recognition of his nephew&#x2019;s true coming of age.</p><p>Many were the noble witnesses to this royal rite of passage. In addition to his family&#x2014;his mother, his surviving brother, and two younger sisters&#x2014;some were young men like the king himself: Ewan Duke of Claibourne, but three-and-thirty; Sir Phares Donovan and Sir Jaska Collins, among the last knights to be made by Brion&#x2019;s late father; Sir Joris Talbot, eldest son of Meara&#x2019;s royal governor; and Sir Jamyl Arilan, a favored companion of the king, knighted by Duke Richard but two years before, whose late uncle Seisyll had served both Brion and his father before him.</p><p>Others had been his father&#x2019;s friends and confidantes: Tiarnï¿½n MacRae and Jiri Redfearn, both with sons now preparing for royal service, and several of the great earls: Jared McLain Earl of Kierney, Caulay MacArdry Earl of Transha, and Sir Kenneth Morgan, now Earl of Lendour, who had come to his title through his young son, Alaric Morgan, who was sired on a Deryni heiress and destined to become the king&#x2019;s magical protector and companion&#x2014;if he could be kept alive that long. For though young Alaric was heir to a great duchy, one of only four in the land, he also was not yet eight years old, with powerful enemies who would risk much to see him dead.</p><p>Meanwhile, Brion King of Gwynedd had enemies of his own, both east and west. Happily for his young reign, none of these had yet dared any overt measures to undermine his crown&#x2014;none, at least, that had required direct intervention. Separatist factions in Meara, to the west, continued to skirt the edges of rebellion, but nothing had flared that was beyond the ability of the provincial royal governor to quell it. That would change, as it always did in Meara&#x2014;King Donal had been obliged to mount expeditions into Meara on a regular basis&#x2014;but for now, all was quiet in the province.</p><p>So it was, as well, in Torenth, to the east&#x2014;at least so far as anyone knew. Not long before Brion&#x2019;s accession, the Kingdom of Torenth had suffered serious upheavals in the highest echelons of power: the still-unexplained death of King Nimur&#x2019;s eldest son, Crown Prince Nimur, and the subsequent setting aside of the second son, Prince Torval, in favor of Prince Kï¿½roly, the meek and bookish third son. Torenth had offered no official statement beyond the bare announcement of Prince Nimur&#x2019;s passing, but the House of Furstï¿½n was Deryni, and used its magic openly&#x2014;which could explain much. Persistent rumor had it that the true cause of Prince Nimur&#x2019;s death had been a magical experiment gone horribly wrong, and that his brother Torval had been present, and was driven mad by what he had seen and experienced.</p><p>Whatever the cause, this unforeseen shift in the Torenthi succession had left Torenth ill equipped to take advantage of the youth and inexperience of Gwynedd&#x2019;s new king. Both Prince Nimur and his brother had been grown men, well capable of backing up an aging sire in declining health; and neither would have hesitated to take up the Torenthi cause, which was the eventual re-conquest of Gwynedd.</p><p>That assumption appeared not to hold true for Prince Kï¿½roly, the new Torenthi heir, who was a decade older than Brion, but had received only a rudimentary portion of the education for kingship that was lavished on his two elder brothers&#x2014;and his own heir was young yet, and certainly lacking in the training of a future king. Of a certainty, Kï¿½roly would have set about remedying that deficiency while Brion scrambled to complete his own training for kingship, but thus far, Torenth had made no move beyond the usual border incursions that tested periodically at Gwynedd&#x2019;s eastern defenses.</p><p>Old King Nimur had even sent an envoy bearing his congratulations on King Brion&#x2019;s knighting&#x2014;Count Jï¿½nos Sokrat, aged but little since his visit for Brion&#x2019;s fourteenth birthday observances&#x2014;but no Torenthi royalty accompanied him this time around. The king&#x2019;s advisors duly noted the Torenthi presence, and the absence of any over-large escort, and concluded that the visit was unlikely to spawn any great threat. Brion, so advised, put the matter out of his head and set about readying himself for the ceremony.<br><br> <b>Chapter 1</b></p><p>&#x201c;Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;ECCLESIASTES 10:17</p><p>STANDING in his own great hall at Rhemuth, surrounded by men sworn to uphold him, Brion King of Gwynedd knew that the faintly queasy sensation in his gut came of no rational fear for his safety. Nonetheless, the sight of a foreign king standing between him and his throne, armed and crowned, could not but give one pause, especially when that king was accompanied by another prince regarded as one of the most puissant warriors in all the Eleven Kingdoms.</p><p>That the two men were his royal uncles only partially reassured, for blood greed had been the downfall of many a young king come prematurely to his crown, with still much to learn of his craft as monarch and warrior&#x2014;and Brion had been but fourteen at his coronation, hardly four years before.</p><p>Nonetheless, all experience before and since that day declared that Brion King of Gwynedd need harbor no such misgivings about these two men. For as long as he could remember, Prince Richard Haldane, younger half-brother of his late father, had been his teacher, his mentor, his most merciless critic when Brion failed to do his very best.</p><p>As for the goodwill of his other uncle&#x2014;the one who wore a crown of his own&#x2014;that, likewise, was beyond question. Illann King of Howicce and Llannedd was the beloved elder brother of Brion&#x2019;s mother, the Dowager Queen Richeldis, come especially to honor this milestone in his nephew&#x2019;s young reign. He stood now at Richard&#x2019;s left, peacock-bright in the colors of Howicce and Llannedd amid all that Haldane crimson. Both he and Richard were the sons of kings, of blood equally royal to Brion&#x2019;s own, yet they had come to their feet at their nephew&#x2019;s approach, inclining their heads in respect.</p><p>The man who had presented the royal candidate, and had fixed the golden spurs to his heels, was also of blood both ancient and royal. Ewan Duke of Claibourne was a direct descendant of the last prince of Kheldour, to the north, and one of only four dukes in Gwynedd. Assisting him had been the scion of another great ducal family: Jared Earl of Kierney, deputizing for his ailing father, the Duke of Cassan. Like the royal uncles, both of these men also wore noble coronets upon their brows, and all of them bore steel at their hips.</p><p>By contrast, Brion King of Gwynedd wore no crown or other emblem of his royal estate, no rich raiment or even any weapon. With his sable hair caught back severely in a warrior&#x2019;s knot, he had donned the robes traditional to any candidate for knighthood: the unadorned inner robe of white, signifying the purity of his honor, partially covered by the stark black over-tunic symbolic of the grave to which all eventually must come.</p><p>Over both lay the bloodred mantle: fittingly, in Brion&#x2019;s case, of Haldane crimson. To such blood had he been born&#x2014;blood which, even more than any mere knight, he must be willing to shed in defense of his realm, even unto death. At his coronation, the new king had pledged his life to his kingdom: reckoned a man, in law, for the governing of his realm, and well enough prepared in mind, but all too aware that he wore still the body of a half-grown youth, with much yet to learn of the warrior he must become, if he hoped to keep his crown.</p><p>That he had kept it thus far was due, in part, to his royal uncles, to the princely dukes flanking him, and to the loyalty and courage of the sandy-haired man standing close beside the throne: Sir Kenneth Morgan Earl of Lendour, who bore the great state crown of leaves and crosses intertwined as if it were no more burden than its mere weight of gold and precious stones, though he had saved it and Brion&#x2019;s life on more than one occasion.</p><p>And the towheaded boy at Kenneth&#x2019;s side, who had proudly carried the golden spurs now affixed to the king&#x2019;s heels, and assisted in their fastening, was cut from the same cloth as his sire: quick and earnest, utterly devoted to Brion, and so much more than he appeared to be, for all that he was only seven years of age. Because his mother had been heiress to a great duchy, Alaric Morgan would be Duke of Corwyn when he came of age, one of the most powerful men in the land. But Alyce de Corwyn had also been Deryni, possessor of powers both feared and resented by ordinary folk&#x2014;which meant that many feared who and what young Alaric was, and what he might become.</p><p>The Church, in particular, had made its position abundantly clear regarding Deryni, for those trained in that heritage were believed to wield extraordinary powers that could compromise another&#x2019;s free will and even enslave the soul of the unwitting. Several of Gwynedd&#x2019;s bishops, some of whom were present today, had been particularly vocal in their condemnation, and one of them had nearly been the death of Alaric&#x2019;s mother before he was even born.</p><p>Yet King Brion&#x2019;s father, only days before his death, had commended the boy Alaric to Brion&#x2019;s especial attention and care, promising a legacy of benign magical powers to be employed in Brion&#x2019;s service, and further powers to be imparted for Brion&#x2019;s own use.</p><p>Was it true? Brion was not sure he remembered all that had been told him, but he believed and hoped that further knowledge would be revealed to him in due course&#x2014;hopefully, well before he really needed it! And it was all somehow linked to the blond boy holding a crimson pillow beside the throne of Gwynedd.</p><p>But that was for the future&#x2014;with any luck, some years in the future, when Alaric Morgan was grown. For now, Brion returned his full focus to his uncles, from whom he was about to receive the knightly accolade, which only another knight might bestow.</p><p>&#x201c;Your Royal Highness,&#x201d; a herald intoned, addressing Richard, &#x201c;having been invested with the spurs, the noble squire Brion Haldane now presents himself before the throne of Gwynedd to request the accolade from your hand, that he may henceforth be recognized as a knight.&#x201d;</p><p>Richard inclined his head, a faint smile curving within the sable mustache and close-clipped beard as his eyes met Brion&#x2019;s, Haldane grey to Haldane grey. In that moment, wearing Haldane crimson and a royal diadem, with one hand resting on the hilt of the sword at his hip, he very much resembled his late brother.</p><p>&#x201c;Kneel now, Brion Haldane,&#x201d; he commanded.</p><p>With a nod of his head that was more jerky than intended, Brion moved forward to kneel on the scarlet cushion that young Alaric Morgan now set atop the first step of the dais; before, it had borne the golden spurs. As he settled himself and looked up, Richard turned to the crimson-clad duty-squire standing behind him: Brion&#x2019;s younger brother and heir presumptive, the twelve-year-old Prince Nigel, who extended the hilt of the sheathed Haldane sword, borne by many generations of Haldane kings. He retained the jeweled scabbard as his uncle drew forth the blade in a hiss of fine steel, clasping it to his breast in wide-eyed awe as Richard raised the blade and briefly brought the sword&#x2019;s cross-hilt to his lips in salute.</p><p>Richard paused then as King Illann reached across to rest his bejeweled hand atop Richard&#x2019;s, in pointed reminder that <i>this</i> knighthood came by way of <i>two</i> lines of royal kings and noble knights. The significance was not lost on Brion or, indeed, on any of those present.</p><p>Very briefly, as the flat of the blade descended toward his right shoulder, Brion closed his eyes and prayed that he might be worthy of this new charge, then lifted his gaze to Richard&#x2019;s once more, as the flat of the blade touched his right shoulder and Richard spoke.</p><p>&#x201c;In the name of the Father, and of the Son&#x201d;&#x2014;the blade lifted to touch the left shoulder&#x2014;&#x201c;and of the Holy Spirit&#x201d;&#x2014;the blade arched upward to briefly rest atop Brion&#x2019;s head&#x2014;&#x201c;be thou a good and faithful knight. Amen.&#x201d;</p><p>As the blade lifted again, to briefly rest over Richard&#x2019;s right shoulder, he glanced aside at Illann with a speaking glance. Smiling, Illann offered the new knight his right hand and said, &#x201c;Arise, Sir Brion Haldane, and be invested with the further symbols of your new estate.&#x201d;</p><p>Murmurs of approval rippled among the assembled witnesses as Brion clasped his uncle&#x2019;s hand and got to his feet, grinning as he accepted the bear hug that the older man offered. Richard, after passing the Haldane blade to Prince Nigel, likewise offered the new knight a quick embrace. As he did so, a beaming Dowager Queen Richeldis joined them from the sidelines, flanked by Brion&#x2019;s two younger sisters. Xenia, the adoring thirteen-year-old, proudly bore the white belt across both hands like some holy relic: the most visible outward symbol of the honor her brother had just received. Silke, who was nine, had been entrusted with a single red rose.</p><p>Composing himself to a properly kingly mien, Brion bent to kiss his mother&#x2019;s hand, then straightened and lifted his arms to either side so that she and his sisters could pass the belt around his waist and under his mantle, stark white against the sable of his over-robe.</p><p>&#x201c;Congratulations, my son,&#x201d; his mother murmured, as she fastened its jeweled clasp. &#x201c;May this belt be always a reminder to keep your honor spotless.&#x201d;</p><p>When she had kissed him on both cheeks and hugged him close, Silke shyly presented him with her rose, which he tucked into his belt. He then accepted a kiss from each of his sisters, in turn.</p></p><h2>Instant Korean: How to Express Over 1,000 Different Ideas with Just 100 Key Words and Phrases!

A terrible story not least because there were so many other ways in which Germany&#39;s history could have been played out. With authority, skill and compassion, Evans recreates a country torn apart by overwhelming economic, political and social blows: the First World War, Versailles, hyperinflation and the Great Depression. One by one these blows ruined or pushed aside almost everything admirable about Germany, leaving the way clear for a truly horrifying ideology to take command.</p><p>Richard J Evans is Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University. His previous books include In Defence of History and Telling Lies About Hitler. He lives outside Cambridge.On 10 May 1933, German students organized an "act against the un-German spirit" in nineteen university towns across the land. They compiled a list of "un-German" books, seized them from all the libraries they could find, piled them up in public squares and set them alight. In Berlin the book-burning event was joined at the students&#x2019; request by Joseph Goebbels. He told them that they were "doing the right thing in committing the evil spirit of the past to the flames" in what he called a "strong, great and symbolic act.&#x201d;<br><br>One after another, books were thrown onto the funeral pyre of intellect, to the accompaniment of slogans such as "Against class struggle and materialism, for the national community and an idealistic outlook: Marx, Kautsky"; "Against decadence and moral decay, for discipline and morality in family and state: Heinrich Mann, Ernst Glaeser, Erich Kï¿½stner."&nbsp; The works of Freud were consigned to the flames for their "debasing exaggeration of man&#x2019;s animal nature"; the books of the popular historian and biographer Emil Ludwig were burned for their "denigration" of the "great figures" of German history; the writings of the radical pacifist journalists Kurt Tucholsky and Karl von Ossietzky were destroyed for their "arrogance and presumption." A particular category in itself was reserved for Erich Maria Remarque, whose critical novel All Quiet on the Western Front was thrown onto the fire "against literary betrayal of the soldiers of the World War, for the education of the nation in the spirit of military preparedness." Many other books besides those read out in these incantatory slogans were thrown onto the pyres. The national student organization issued "twelve theses against the un-German spirit" to accompany the action, demanding the introduction of censorship and the purging of libraries and declaring: "Our opponent is the Jew and anyone who submits to him."<br><br>Already by 12 March, in a prelude to this action, stormtroopers had ransacked the library of the trade union center in Heidelberg, removed books and burned them in a small bonfire outside the door. A similar event had taken place outside Magnus Hirschfeld&#x2019;s sex research institute in Berlin on 6 May.&nbsp; But the 10 May book burning was on a much larger scale and much more thoroughly prepared. Students had been combing libraries and bookshops in readiness for the occasion since the middle of April. Some booksellers courageously refused to hang up posters advertising the event in their shop windows, but many others gave in to the threats with which the students accompanied their action. In Heidelberg, where the book burning took place on 17 May, the students processed with flaming torches, accompanied by SA, SS and steel helmets and members of the dueling corps, and threw Communist and Social Democratic insignia into the flames as well as books. The event was accompanied by the singing of the Horst Wessel Song and the national anthem. Speeches were delivered in which the action was presented as a blow against the "un-German spirit." The Weimar Republic had incorporated this "Jewish-subversive" spirit; it was now finally consigned to history.<br><br>All of this marked the culmination of a widespread action "against the un-German spirit" set in motion weeks before by the Propaganda Ministry. As so often in the history of the Third Reich, the apparently spontaneous action was in fact centrally coordinated, although not by Goebbels, but by the national student union. The Nazi official in charge of purging Berlin&#x2019;s public libraries helpfully provided a list of the books to be burned, and the central office of the national student union wrote and distributed the slogans to be used in the ceremony. In this way, the Nazi student organization ensured that the book burning took a roughly similar course in all the university towns where it was carried out. And where the students led, others followed, in localities across the land. At a celebration of the summer solstice of 1933 in the small town of Neu-Isenburg, for instance, eight thousand people watched "Marxist" literature being burned in a huge pile in an open space behind the fire station. As the local women&#x2019;s gymnastics club danced around the fire, the local party leader gave a speech, followed by a rendition of the Horst Wessel Song by the assembled multitude.&nbsp; Book burning was by no means a practice confined to the highly educated.<br><br>But one precedent above all others inspired the action of 10 May 1933. The Nazi book burning was a conscious echo of an earlier ritual performed by radical nationalist students at the celebration of the 18 October 1817 three hundredth anniversary of Martin Luther&#x2019;s famous launching of the Reformation with the publication of his theses attacking the Catholic Church. At the close of the day&#x2019;s festivities at the Wartburg castle in Thuringia, the students had thrown symbols of authority and "un-German" books such as the Code Napolï¿½on onto a bonfire in a form of symbolic execution. This action might have provided a precedent in Germany&#x2019;s canon of nationalist demonstrations, but in fact it had little in common with its later imitation in 1933, since a principal concern of the Wartburg festival was to express solidarity with Poland and to demonstrate in favor of the freedom of the German press, still constricted by massive censorship from the police regime inspired by Prince Metternich. Still, as the flames rose to the skies in Germany&#x2019;s ancient seats of learning on 10 May 1933, encouraged or tolerated by the newly Nazified university authorities, there must have been more than a few who recalled the poet Heinrich Heine&#x2019;s comment</p><h2>Make a Splash!: A Kid&#x2019;s Guide to Protecting Our Oceans, Lakes, Rivers, &amp; Wetlands</h2><p><p>This elementary-level counterpart to the award-winning <i>Going Blue: A Teen Guide to Saving Our Oceans, Lakes, Rivers, &amp; Wetlands </i>teaches elementary kids about the earth&#x2019;s water crisis and empowers them to do something about it.

A man could tell a lot about a place just by looking at the people on the streets, and by that standard Prosper was quiet, steady, and -- well -- prosperous. A boomtown might be more exciting than a town like Prosper, and people could make a lot of money in such places, but mining towns tended to die as soon as the ore played out.<br><br>Prosper, on the other hand, had started out as a single building serving triple duty as general store, bar, and livery for the few settlers around. Lucas could remember when the site Prosper now occupied had been nothing but bare ground and the only white men for miles had been on the Double C. The gold rush in 1858 had changed all that, bringing thousands of men into the Colorado mountains in search of instant wealth; no gold had been found around Prosper, but a few people had seen the land and stayed, starting small ranches. More people had meant a larger demand for goods. The lone general store/bar/livery soon had another building standing beside it, and the tiny settlement that would one day become Prosper, Colorado, was born.<br><br>Lucas had seen a lot of boomtowns, not just in Colorado, and they were all very similar in their frenzied pace, as muddy streets swarmed with miners and those looking to separate the miners from their gold: gamblers, saloon owners, whores, and claim-jumpers. He was glad that Prosper hadn't been blessed -- or cursed, depending on your point of view -- by either gold or silver. Being what it was, it would still be there when most of the boomtowns were nothing but weathered skeletons.<br><br>It was a sturdy little town, a good place to raise a family, as evidenced by the three hundred and twenty-eight souls who lived there. All of the businesses were located on the long center street, around which nine streets of residences had arranged themselves. Most of the houses were small and simple, but some of the people, like banker Wilson Millican, had already possessed money before settling in Prosper. Their houses wouldn't have looked out of place in Denver or even in the larger cities back East.<br><br>Prosper had only one saloon and no whorehouses, though it was well known among the men in town (and the women, although the men didn't know it) that the two saloon girls would take care of any extra itches they happened to have, for a price. There was a church on the north end of town, and a school for the youngsters. Prosper had a bank, two hotels, three restaurants (counting the two in the hotels), a general store, two livery stables, a dry goods store, a barber shop, a cobbler, a blacksmith, and even a hat shop for the ladies. The stage came through once a week.<br><br>The entire town was there only because the Cochran family had carved the big Double C spread out of nothing, fighting the Comanche and Arapaho, paying for the land with Cochran blood. Lucas had been the first Cochran born there, and now he was the only one left; he had buried his two brothers and his mother back during the Indian wars, and his father had died the month before. Other ranchers had moved in, but the Cochrans had been the first, and had bought the security the town now enjoyed with Cochran lives. Everyone who had been in town for long knew that Prosper's backbone wasn't the long center street, but the line of graves in the family burial plot on the Double C.<br><br>Lucas's bootheels thudded on the sidewalk as he walked toward the general store. A cold wind had sprung up that had the smell of snow on it, and he looked at the sky. Low gray clouds were building over the mountains, signaling yet another delay to spring. Warmer weather should arrive any day, but those low clouds said not quite yet. He passed a woman with her shawl pulled tight around her shoulders and tipped his hat to her. "Looks like more snow, Mrs. Padgett."<br><br>Beatrice Padgett gave him a friendly smile. "It does that, Mr. Cochran."<br><br>He entered the general store and nodded to Mr. Winches, the proprietor. Winches had done right well in the ten years Lucas had been gone, enough to hire himself a clerk who took care of most of the stocking. "Hosea," Lucas said by way of greeting.<br><br>"How do, Lucas? It's turning a mite cold out there, ain't it?"<br><br>"It'll snow by morning. The snowpacks can use it, but I'm ready for spring myself."<br><br>"Ain't we all? You need anything in particular?"<br><br>"Just some gun oil."<br><br>"Down the left, toward the back."<br><br>"Thanks."<br><br>Lucas went down the aisle Hosea had indicated, almost bumping into a farm woman who was fingering the harnesses. He muttered an absentminded apology and continued without more than a glance. Farming was hard on a woman, making her look old before her time. Besides, he had just spotted a familiar blond head over by the sacks of flour, and a sense of satisfaction filled him. Olivia Millican was just the type he would want when he got around to getting married: well-bred, with a pleasant disposition, and pretty enough for him to look forward to bedding her for the rest of his life. He had plans for the Double C, and the ruthless ambition to put those plans into effect.<br><br>There were two other young women standing with Olivia, so he didn't approach, just contented himself with a tip of his hat when her eyes strayed his way. To her credit she didn't giggle, though the two with her did. Instead she gave him a grave nod of acknowledgment, and if the color in her cheeks heightened a bit, it just made her prettier.<br><br>He paid for the gun oil and left, not getting the door shut good behind him before a muffled flurry of squeals and giggles broke out, though again Olivia didn't contribute.<br><br>"He danced with you twice!"<br><br>"What did he say?"<br><br>"I was so excited when he asked me, I almost fainted dead away!"<br><br>"Does he dance well? I swear I had butterflies in my stomach just at the thought of having his arm around my waist! It's just as well he didn't ask me, because I'd have made a fool of myself, but at the same time I admit I was powerfully jealous of you, Olivia."<br><br>Dee Swann glanced at the knot of three young women, two of whom were taking turns gabbing without allowing Olivia a chance to answer. Olivia was blushing a little but nevertheless maintaining her composure. They stood off to the side in the general store and were making an effort to keep their voices down, but their excitement had caught Dee's attention. It took only a moment of eavesdropping to discern that the gossip was, as usual, about some man, in this case Lucas Cochran. She continued to listen as she selected a new bridle. The stiff leather straps slipped through her fingers as she searched for the one that was most pliable.<br><br>"He was very gentlemanly," Olivia said in an even tone. The banker's daughter was seldom ruffled. Dee looked up again with amusement sparkling in her eyes at Olivia's unwavering good manners, and their gazes met across the aisles in silent communication. Olivia understood Dee's mirth as plainly as if she had laughed aloud, just as she understood why Dee not only didn't join them but preferred that Olivia not even acknowledge her presence beyond a polite nod. Dee jealously guarded her privacy, and Olivia respected her old friend enough not to try to include her in a discussion that wouldn't interest her and might actually irritate her.<br><br>Even as small as Prosper was, there was a definite social structure. Dee wouldn't normally have been welcome in the circles in which Olivia moved, and she had long ago made certain her friend understood she didn't want to be made an exception to the rule. Dee was totally disinterested in such socializing. Her penchant for privacy was so strong that though everyone knew they were acquainted, since they had attended the local school together, only the two of them knew how close their friendship really was. Dee never visited Olivia; it was always Olivia who rode out, alone, to Dee's small cabin, but it was an arrangement that suited both of them. Not only was Dee's privacy protected, but Olivia in turn felt a certain freedom, a sense of relief in knowing herself unobserved and unjudged at least for a few hours by anyone other than Dee, who was the least judgmental person Olivia had ever met. Only with Dee could she truly be herself. This wasn't to say that she was in reality anything less than a lady, but merely that she enjoyed being able to say whatever she thought. In their shared glance was Olivia's promise to ride out soon and tell Dee all that had happened since they had last seen each other, which had been over a month ago due to the late winter weather.<br><br>Having made her selection, Dee took the bridle and her other purchases up to the counter where Hosea Winches waited. He painstakingly tallied her selections on the ledger page that bore her name at the top, then subtracted the total from the amount of credit remaining from the year before. There was only a small amount left, she saw, reading the figures upside down, but it would last her until her crops came in this summer.<br><br>Mr. Winches turned the ledger around for her to double-check his arithemetic. While she ran a finger down his columns he eyed the group of young women still standing at the back of the store. Bursts of stifled laughter, high-pitched with excitement, made him snort. "Sounds like a fox got in the chicken house, what with all that squawking," he mumbled.<br><br>Dee nodded her satisfaction with his totals and turned the ledger back to its original position, then gathered up her purchases. "Thank you, Mr. Winches."<br><br>He shook his head absently. "Be thankful you're more levelheaded than some," he said. "You'd think they ain't never seen a man before."<br><br>Dee looked back at the others, then at Mr. Winches again, and they both shrugged their shoulders. So what if Lucas Cochran was back in town after a ten-year absence? It didn't mean anything to either of them.<br><br>She had recognized Cochran when he had bumped her in the store aisle, of course, but she hadn't spoken because recognizing someone wasn't the same as knowing him, and she doubted that he had recognized her. After all, he had left Prosper shortly after her folks had settled in the area. She had been a fourteen-year-old schoolgirl, while he had been eight years older, a grown man. They had never even met. She knew his face, but she didn't know the man or much about him.<br><br>Dee made it a practice to mind her own business and expected others to do the same, but even so she had been aware of what was going on at the Double C. It was the biggest ranch in the area, so everyone paid some attention. Ellery Cochran, Lucas's father, had died a few weeks before. Dee hadn't known the man personally, only enough to put a name to his face whenever their paths crossed in town. She hadn't thought anything unusual of his passing; death was common, and he'd died peacefully, which was about as much as a body could ask for.<br><br>The matter was of only mild interest to her, on the level of hearing that a neighbor had a new baby. She had never had any dealings with Ellery, so she didn't expect to have any with his son. She had already forgotten about the Cochrans by the time she stepped out into the icy wind. She tugged her father's old coat more snugly around her and jammed his too-big hat down around her ears, ducking her head to keep the wind off her face as she walked hurriedly to the wagon and climbed up onto the plank seat.<br><br>It began snowing late that afternoon, but the swirling of the silent white flakes was one of her favorite sights and filled her with contentment, rather than restlessness at yet another delay of spring. Dee loved the changing seasons, each with its own magic and beauty, and she lived close enough to the land to become immersed in the inexorable rhythm of nature. Her animals were snug in the barn, her chores finished for the day, and she was safe in the cabin with a brisk fire snapping cheerfully, warming her on the outside, while a cup of coffee warmed her on the inside. She had nothing more pressing to do than sit with her feet stretched toward the fire and read one of the precious few books she had obtained over the winter. Winter was her time of rest; she was too busy during the other three seasons to have either the time or the energy for much reading.<br><br>But the book soon dropped to her lap, and she leaned her head against the high back of the rocking chair, her eyes focused inward as she planned her garden. The corn had done so well last year that it might be a good thing to plant more of it. Corn was never a waste; what the townspeople didn't buy, she could always use as feed for the horse. But extra corn would mean that she would have to cut back on some other vegetable, and she couldn't decide if that would be wise. By careful planning and experimentation she knew to the square yard how much she could tend, and tend well, by herself. She didn't intend to expand at the expense of the quality of her vegetables. Nor did she want to hire a young boy to help her. It was selfish of her, perhaps, but the greatest pleasure she got from her garden, other than the primitive satisfaction of making things grow, was her complete independence. She stood alone and reveled in it.<br><br>At first it had frightened her when she had found herself, at the age of eighteen, totally alone in life. When Dee was sixteen, only a couple of years after they had settled in the narrow, fertile valley just outside Prosper, Colorado, her mother, a schoolteacher, had died, leaving her daughter a legacy of books, an appreciation of the benefits of hard work, and a level head. Barely two more years had passed before her father, George Swann, had managed to get himself kicked in the head by a mule, and he died in his bed the next day without regaining consciousness.<br><br>The silence, the emptiness had haunted her. Her solitude, her vulnerability had frightened her. A woman alone was a woman without protection. Dee had dug her fathers grave herself and buried him, not wanting anyone to know she was all alone on the homestead. When she had to go into Prosper for supplies she turned aside friendly queries about her father, saying only that he couldn't leave the ranch just then, and she comforted her conscience with the knowledge that she hadn't lied, even if she hadn't told the exact truth.<br><br>George had died early in the winter, and during the long, cold months Dee had grieved and pondered her situation. She owned this fertile little valley now; it was too small to support a large-scale ranching operation, but too large for her to work herself. On the other hand, the soil was lush, fed by crystal-clear Angel Creek as it poured out of Prosper Canyon and ran right down the middle of the valley. She could never remember deciding on any exact day what she was going to do with the rest of her life; she had just done what she had to as each day presented itself.<br><br>First and foremost had been the necessity of learning how to protect herself. With dogged determination each day she set out her father's weapons: a Colt.36 handgun, an old Sharps rifle, and a shiny, year-old double-barreled shotgun. The handgun was rusty with disuse, as George hadn't gotten it out of the holster where it had been hanging on a peg since they'd settled on Angel Creek. He hadn't been any good with a handgun, he'd often joked; just give him a shotgun, so all he had to do was aim in the general direction of something.<br><br>Dee had felt much the same way, but she cleaned and oiled all three of the weapons, something she had often seen her father do, and practiced loading...</p><h2>Demon</h2><p>Harry White is the man other men want to be: admired by his peers, talented, rich, and desired by countless women. His steady rise to a position of unprecedented influence in a New York investment firm seems inevitable to those who know him, and on the way he acquires a beautiful wife and children. But with every achievement the desire to destroy what is his grows stronger. A demon within drives him to sexual excess, petty crime and eventually murder. &#34;The Demon&#34; explores the dark side of a man&#39;s ambitions with unflinching determination. Harry White&#39;s story is a gripping twentieth-century tragedy.</p><p>Hubert Selby, Jr. was born in Brooklyn in 1928. At the age of 15, he dropped out of school and went to sea with the merchant marines. While at sea he was diagnosed with lung disease. With no other way to make a living, he decided to try writing: &#39;I knew the alphabet. Maybe I could be a writer.&#39; In 1964 he completed his first book, Last Exit to Brooklyn, which has since become a cult classic. In 1966, it was the subject of an obscenity trial in the UK. His other books include The Room, The Demon, Requiem for a Dream, Song of the Silent Snow, The Willow Tree and Waiting Period. In 2000, Requiem for a Dream starred Jared Leto and Ellen Burstyn and was directed by Darren Aronofsky.

In Europe, they go mad for them! They call it &#34;the 9th Art.&#34; Every year, a thriving international festival takes place at Angoulï¿½me (France) to celebrate graphic novels, a popular art form as well respected as any literary genre. In fact, there are all kinds of BD for both adults and children. They are available everywhere from the village bookshop to the supermarket via cultural media stores like La FNAC or Virgin. Conscious that the English reading public at large was not properly aware of BD, and out of admiration for the work of Goscinny (the author of Asterix), we decided to start with another of his characters: Lucky Luke. Lucky Luke is this super cool cowboy who, with his wisecracking horse Jolly Jumper, protects the population West of the Mississippi from the exaction of all kinds of villains, some real (The Daltons, Jesse James) and some invented. The stories, always well researched, combine fact, fiction and humorous send off with a refreshing lack of political correctness. So far, we have published seven titles titles - Calamity Jane, Jesse James, Dalton City, The Tenderfoot, Ma Dalton, Western Circus and The Dashing White Cowboy. In total, there are over 60 Lucky Luke titles. An amazing success story worldwide for the last 50 years, there are 250 million Lucky Luke books in print in over 26 languages worldwide. From our research, the ecstatic response to the BD by British children proved beyond any doubt that these books deserve to be read by English speakers and that English speaking children deserve the opportunity to read them. Glo&#39;worm sets out to give them this opportunity.The character of Lucky Luke became a legend thanks to Morris (his creator) and Goscinny. These two giants of the 9th art collaborated with passion for more than 20 years until the death of the famous scriptwriter. Rene Goscinny (Lucky Luke, Asterix, Iznogoud, le Petit Nicolas) is one of the most-read French authors in the world. Approximately 500 million copies of his books have been sold.In 1992, Morris received the &#34;Grand Prix Special 20eme Anniversaire&#34; from the international comics show at Angouleme, and in 1998, the French Minister of Culture decorated him with the rank of &#34;Officier des Arts et des Lettres.&#34;</p><h2>Our Prince of Scribes: Writers Remember Pat Conroy</h2><p><p><i>New York Times </i>best-selling writer Pat Conroy (1945&#x2013;2016) inspired a worldwide legion of devoted fans numbering in the millions, but none are more loyal to him and more committed to sustaining his literary legacy than the many writers he nurtured over the course of his fifty-year writing life.

Sherman occupied Savannah and then marched his armies north through the Carolinas. Although much has been written about the military aspects of Sherman's March, Jacqueline Campbell reveals a more complex story. Integrating evidence from Northern soldiers and from Southern civilians, black and white, male and female, Campbell demonstrates the importance of culture for determining the limits of war and how it is fought.<br><br>Sherman's March was an invasion of both geographical and psychological space. The Union army viewed the Southern landscape as military terrain. But when they brought war into Southern households, Northern soldiers were frequently astounded by the fierceness with which many white Southern women defended their homes. Campbell argues that in the household-centered South, Confederate women saw both ideological and material reasons to resist. While some Northern soldiers lauded this bravery, others regarded such behavior as inappropriate and unwomanly. <br><br>Campbell also investigates the complexities behind African Americans' decisions either to stay on the plantation or to flee with Union troops. Black Southerners' delight at the coming of the army of "emancipation" often turned to terror as Yankees plundered their homes and assaulted black women. <br><br>Ultimately, <i>When Sherman Marched North from the Sea</i> calls into question postwar rhetoric that represented the heroic defense of the South as a male prerogative and praised Confederate women for their "feminine" qualities of sentimentality, patience, and endurance. Campbell suggests that political considerations underlie this interpretation--that Yankee depredations seemed more outrageous when portrayed as an attack on defenseless women and children. Campbell convincingly restores these women to their role as vital players in the fight for a Confederate nation, as models of self-assertion rather than passive self-sacrifice. <br><br><br><br></p><p>"A worthy addition to the burgeoning literature focusing on the social and cultural aspects of the Civil War. Concise yet thoroughly researched, it contributes fresh, thought-provoking insights into a long-neglected area of study: the interaction between General William T. Sherman's soldiers and southern civilians, black and white, male and female, during his march through the Carolinas."-- <i>The South Carolina Historical Magazine</i> <br>Blending Civil War and women&#39;s history, Campbell examines the effects of Sherman&#39;s March on the southern home front. She finds that southern women were staunch defenders of their homes and models of self-assertion. She also offers a new appraisal of the complex range of African Americans&#39; reactions to Sherman&#39;s soldiers.</p><h2>A Stolen Childhood: A dark past, a terrible secret, a girl without a future</h2><p><p>Bestselling author and teacher Casey Watson shares the horrifying true story of Kiera Bentley, a 12-year-old girl with a deeply shocking secret she&#x2019;s too young to even understand.</p><p>When Casey first meets Kiera, a small slight girl who&#x2019;s just lashed out at a fellow pupil in assembly, she immediately senses something&#x2019;s wrong.

Dick</b> (1928 &#x2013;1982) remains one of the most celebrated authors of the last century and a looming and illuminating presence in this one. He was the winner of both the prestigious Hugo Award and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award, which honor excellence in science fiction. Inducted in 2007 into the Library of America, which publishes a three-volume collection of his novels, Dick has received unprecedented recognition for his contributions to modern literature, specifically in the area of science fiction. His 45 novels and over 210 short stories have been adapted into numerous films, including the blockbusters <i>Minority Report, Total Recall</i>, and <i>Blade Runner</i>, as well as <i>Impostor, Paycheck, Scanner Darkly, Next</i>, and <i>The Adjustment Bureau</i>.</p><h2>Cavalleria Rusticana and Other Stories (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>The stories of Giovanni Verga (1840-1922) are wonderful evocations of ordinary Italian life, focusing in particular on his native Sicily. In an original and dynamic prose style, he portrays such eternal human themes as love, honour and adultery with rich and colourful language. The inspiration for Mascagni&#39;s opera, &#39;Cavalleria Rusticana&#39; depicts a young man&#39;s triumphal return home from the army, spoilt when he learns that his beloved is engaged to another man. Verga&#39;s acute awareness of the hardships and aspirations of peasant life can be seen in stories such as &#39;Nedda&#39;, &#39;Picturesque Lives&#39; and &#39;Black Bread&#39;, while others such as &#39;The Reverend&#39; and &#39;Don Licciu Papa&#39; show the dominance of the church and the law in the Sicilian communities he portrays so vividly.</p><p>Giovanni Verga (1840-1922) was born into a bourgeois family in Sicily and began writing historical romances as a teenager. His later fiction was more naturalistic and dramatic in style and dealt largely with Sicilian rural life. He was introduced to the English-speaking world in the translations of D. H. Lawrence and is now considered to be one of the major Italian nineteenth-century authors. Harry McWilliam has translated Boccaccio&#39;s DECAMERON for Penguin.<b>The She-Wolf</b><p>She was dark-haired, tall and lean, with firm, well-rounded breasts, though she was no longer young, and she had a pale complexion, like someone forever in the grip of malaria. The pallor was relieved by a pair of huge eyes and fresh red lips that looked as though they would eat you.</p><p>In the village they called her the She-Wolf because, no matter what she had, she was never satisfied. The woman crossed themselves whenever they saw her coming, lone as a stray bitch, with the restless and wary appearance of a starving wolf. She would gobble up their sons and their husbands in the twinkling of an eye with those red lips of hers, and draw them to the tail of her skirt and transfix them with those devilish eyes, as though they were standing before the altar at St Agrippina's. Luckily the She-Wolf herself never set foot inside the church, either at Easter or at Christmas or to hear Mass or to go to confession. Father Angiolino of St Mary of Jesus, a true servant of God, had lost his soul on her account.Maricchia, poor girl, a good and worthy soul, shed tears in secret because she was the She-Wolf's daughter and nobody would ever want to marry her, even though she too had a fine trousseau tucked away in a chest and a patch of decent land in the sun, like any other girl in the village.</p><p>Then it happened that the She-Wolf fell in love with a handsome young fellow back from the army, when the two of them were hay-making on the notary's farm. She'd fallen for him lock, stock and barrel, her flesh burning beneath her thick cotton bodice, and, staring into his eyes, she was overcome with the kind of thirst you would experience down in the valley on a hot midsummer day. But he just kept scything calmly away, head down over the hay, saying "What's the matter, Pina?". In the vast expansive fields, where all you could hear was the chirping of the crickets as they leapt, with the sun beating straight down, the She-Wolf tied up sheaf after sheaf, bundle after bundle, showing no sign of fatigue, never looking up for an instant, never putting her lips to the flask, just so long as she could be there behind Nanni, while he scythed away, asking her every so often, "What is it you want, Pina?".</p><p>One evening she told him, while the men, exhausted from their day's labours, were nodding off to sleep in the barn, and the dogs were filling the dark air of the countryside with their howling, "It's you I want! You that are beautiful as the sun, and sweet as the honey! I want you!".</p><p>"It's the unmarried daughter of yours that I want," Nanni replied, laughing.The She-Wolf thrust her hands into her hair, tearing at the sides of her head without uttering a word, then strode off and stayed away from the barn. But then the olive-crushing season came round in October, she set her eyes on Nanni again because he was working next door to were she lived, and the creaking of the press kept her awake the whole night long.</p><p>"Pick up that sack of olives," she said to her daughter, "and come with me."Nanni was pushing the olives under the mill wheel with his shovel, and shouting "Gee up there!" to the mule to keep it moving.</p><p> "Do you want my daughter Marricchia?" Pina asked.</p><p>"What are you going to give her?" Nanni replied.</p><p>"She's got the things her father left, and she can have my house into the bargain. All you need to leave me is the corner of the kitchen to spread out my palliasse."</p><p>"In that case we can talk it over at Christmas." said Nanni.</p><p>Nanni was covered in grease sweat from the oil and the fermenting olives, and Maricchia wanted nothing whatever to do with him, but when they got home her mother grabbed her by the hair and said to her through clenched teeth:"If you don't take him, I'll kill you!".You would have thought the She-Wolf was ill, and people were saying that when the Devil grows old he goes into hiding. She never wandered about the village any more, she didn't stand on the doorstep flashing those crazy eyes of hers. Her son-in-law, whenever she fixed those eyes on him, began to laugh, and pulled out his scapular to bless himself with. Maracchia stayed at home, breastfeeding the children, while her mother went off to the fields to work alongside the men; just like a man, in fact, digging, hoeing, rounding up the cattle, and pruning the vines in all weather, in January with an icy wind from the east, or August with the sirocco from the south, when at the end of the day the mules would be drooping their heads and the men would be sitting asleep, propped against the wall with their mouths hanging open. 'In hours that run from dusk till dawn goes no good woman ever born,' and Pina was the only living soul you could see out and about, picking her way over the boundless fields that stretched into the heat haze of the far distance towards Etna, shrouded in mist, where the sky bore down on the horizon."Wake up!" said the She-Wolf to Nanni, who was lying asleep in the ditch under the dust-laden hedgerow, resting his head between his arms. "Wake up, I've brought you some wine to wet your throat."</p><p>Nanni opened his eyes wide, stupefied, still half-asleep, to find her standing over him, white-faced, thrusting her breast towards him and fixing him with her coal-black eyes, and he stretched out his hands, groping the air.</p><p>"No! No good woman's abroad from dusk till dawn!" bewailed Nanni, pressing his face down again into the dry grass of the ditch as hard as he could, with his fingernails tearing at his hair. "Go away! Go away! Keep away from the barn!"</p><p>She did go away, did the She-Wolf, tying up her splendid tresses as she went, staring ahead of her toward the hot fields of stubble with her coal-black eyes.</p><p>But she kept going back to the barn, and Nanni said nothing. In fact, whenever she was late arriving, in the hours that run from dusk till dawn, he would go and wait for her at the top of the ashen-white, deserted lane, with beads of sweat standing out on his forehead. And afterwards he would thrust his hands through his hair and repeat every time, "Go away! Go away! Don't come back to the barn!"</p><p>Maracchia wept day and night, and stared at her mother with tear-filled eyes aflame with jealousy, looking like a wolf-cub herself, every time she saw her returning pale and silent from the fields.</p><p>"You wicked slut!" she cried. "You wicked slut of a mother!"</p><p> "Shut up!"</p><p>"You thief! Thief!"</p><p>"Shut up!"</p><p>"'I'll tell the police sergeant, that's what I'll do!"</p><p>"Go ahead and tell him!"</p><p>She did go ahead, with her children clinging round her neck, totally unafraid, and without shedding a tear. She was like a mad woman, because now she too loved the husband they had forced upon her, all greasy and covered in sweat from the fermenting olives.The sergeant had Nanni called in, and threatened him with prison and the gallows. Nanni stood there sobbing and tearing his hair. He denied nothing, and didn't even try to make excuses."I was tempted!" he cried. "I was tempted by the Devil!"</p><p>He threw himself at the sergeant's feet, pleading with him to send him to prison.</p><p>"For pity's sake, sergeant, take me out of this hell on earth! Have me killed, send me to prison, never let me set eyes on her again, ever!"</p><p>But when the sergeant spoke to the She-Wolf, she replied, "No! I kept a corner of the kitchen to sleep in, when I gave him my house as a dowry. The house is mine. I don't intend to leave it."Shortly after that, Nanni was kicked in the chest by a mule, and was at death's door. But the parish priest refused to bring him the bread of Christ until the She-Wolf left the house. The She-Wolf went away, and her son-in-law could then prepare to take his leave of the world as a good Christian. He confessed and made communion with such an obvious show of repentance and contrition that all the neighbours and onlookers were in tears at the bed of the dying man. And it would have been better if he had died then and there, before the Devil returned to tempt him and to take him over body and soul as soon as he recovered.</p><p>"Leave me alone!" he said to the She-Wolf. "For God's sake, leave me in peace! I stared death in the face! The poor Maricchia is in despair! The whole village knows all about it! It's better for both of us if I don't see you. . . ."</p><p>He would have liked to tear out his eyes so as not to see the eyes of the She-Wolf, who made him surrender body and soul when she fixed them upon him. He no longer knew what to do to release himself from her spell. He paid for Masses for the souls in Purgatory, and asked the parish priest and the sergeant to help him. At Easter he went to confession, and did penance in public by crawling on his belly for six feet over the cobblestones in front of the church. After all that, when the She-Wolf returned to torment him, he said to her:</p><p>"Listen! Just you stay away from the barn, because if you come looking for me again, I swear to God I'll kill you!"</p><p>"Go ahead and kill me," replied the She-Wolf. "It doesn't worry me. I can't live without you."</p><p>When he saw her coming in the distance, through the sown fields, he stopped digging at the vine with his mattock, and went and wrenched the axe from the elm. The She-Wolf saw him coming, pale with frenzy, the axe glittering in the sun, but she never stopped for a moment or lowered her gaze as she carried on walking towards him, with her hands full of bunches of red poppies, devouring him with her coal-black eyes. "Ah!" Nanni stammered. "May your soul roast in Hell!"</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>A Simple Singing (The Sisters of Lancaster County)</h2><p>For years Marie Bachmann thought of herself as the "good" daughter.

Derived from an eighth-century Tibetan Buddhist text, Yantra Yoga includes many positions similar to those of Hatha Yoga in form, but different in the dynamics of the way in which they are practiced, especially in the coordination of movement and breathing. The Yantra Yoga system encompasses 108 sets of movements (yantras) and several types of breathing to be learned at your own pace. Due to its emphasis on uniting breathing and movement, Yantra Yoga can deepen the experience of yoga practitioners from any tradition and profoundly benefit anyone seeking authentic balance, harmony, and the understanding of our true nature.<br><br> Since the eighth century, this yoga teaching has been passed down from teacher to student in an unbroken lineage. Chï¿½gyal Namkhai Norbu, the current lineage holder, began transmitting Yantra Yoga in the West in the 1970s. Presenting detailed instructions accompanied by over 400 instructional photos, the book describes the sequences of movements, methods of breathing, and the concrete health benefits of the practice.<br> &nbsp;<b><br></b></p><p>Born in Eastern Tibet in 1938, Chï¿½gyal Namkhai Norbu&nbsp;is an internationally known Dzogchen Buddhist teacher and author. The direct descendant of the first Dzogchen Tibetan master of Tibet, Norbu spent his childhood receiving many teachings from masters of various traditions. In the 1960s he was invited to teach in Italy. During his career he wrote many books on Tibetan culture and Dzogchen Buddhism. He is the founder of two nonprofit organizations including the Shang Shung Institute for Tibetan Studies, which is dedicated to the preservation of Tibetan culture.<br><br>Born and raised in Italy, Fabio Andrico&nbsp;is an internationally recognized expert in the unique tradition of Tibetan yoga known as yantra yoga. Currently a hatha and yantra yoga instructor and teacher trainer, he studied directly under Tibetan scholar and Dzogchen master Chogyal Namkhai Norbu."Yantra Yoga is a profound movement practice that encompasses the coordination of the breath with movement in a way that creates flexibility and harmony within the whole being. Transmitted in an authentic lineage from an ancient tantra, this practice is amazingly beneficial. I highly recommend this book."<br>&#x2014;Lama Tsultrim Allione, author of <i>Women of Wisdom</i> and <i>Feeding Your Demons</i><br><br>"Chï¿½gyal Namkhai Norbu is one of the greatest Tibetan meditation masters and scholars teaching in the West."<br>&#x2014;Lama Surya Das, author of <i>Awakening the Buddha Within</i> and <i>Awakening the Buddhist Heart,</i> and the founder of the Dzogchen Foundation in Massachusetts<br><br><i>"Tibetan Yoga of Movement</i>&nbsp;deliberately focuses on the aspects of the practice that are readily accessible to everyone, independent of their views, ideals, aspirations and capacities.

Having spent four years clearing a secret passage inside Palenque's Temple of the Inscriptions, Mexican archaeologist Alberto Ruz gazed into a vaulted chamber. There, beneath a gigantic carved stone block, he would make a spectacular discovery: the intact burial of King Pakal, complete with jade jewelry and an exquisite burial mask.<br><br> Pakal was one of the greatest ancient rulers and the most prominent among a long line of monarchs who held sway at Palenque from AD 300 to 800. This "queen of Maya cities," as Palenque has been called, fell into ruin and was abandoned along with other great urban centers when Maya civilization suffered a mysterious collapse more than 1000 years ago.<br><br> Through the eyes of David and George Stuart, we travel with pioneer artists and archaeologists from the eighteenth century on as they rediscovered Palenque and attempted, in the oppressive tropical heat, to document the city's graceful and ornate palaces, temples, bas-reliefs, and hieroglyphic inscriptions. These inscriptions lay largely unread until, in the late twentieth century, major breakthroughs in decipherment revealed Palenque's history. David Stuart, one of the leading decipherers, portrays a lost world of palace intrigue, of brilliant architects, of gods and revered ancestors.<br><br> Today Palenque, proclaimed a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a place of new reverence and relevance for millions of modern Maya, New Age spiritualists, and all those fascinated by the history of the Maya. 150 illustrations, 40 in color</p><p><p><b>David Stuart</b> is Professor of Mesoamerican Art and Writing at the University of Texas, Austin.</p><p><b>George Stuart</b> is founding president of the Center for Maya Research in North Carolina and the former Staff Archaeologist of the National Geographic Society.</p>&#x201c;The story of a great ancient city that should not be missed.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>American Archaeology</em></strong></p><h2>To Hear The Angels Sing</h2><p>In this classic book Dorothy Maclean tells her story of how she came to be one of the three founders of the Findhorn Community in Scotland.

Heulwen, daughter of Welsh Marcher baron Guyon FitzMiles, has grown up with her father's ward, Adam de Lacey. There has always been a spark between them, but when Heulwen marries elsewhere, to Ralf le Chevalier, a devastated Adam absents himself on various diplomatic missions for King Henry I.<br><br>When Ralf is killed in a skirmish, Heulwen's father considers a new marriage for her with his neighbour's son, Warrin de Mortimer. Adam, recently returned to England, has good reason to loathe Warrin and is determined not to lose Heulwen a second time. But Heulwen is torn between her duty to her father and the pull of her heart. Adam is no longer the awkward boy she remembers, but a man who stirs every fibre of her being - which places them both in great danger, because Warrin de Mortimer is not a man to be crossed and the future of a country is at stake . . .</p><p>Much of Elizabeth Chadwick&#39;s research is carried out as a member of Regia Anglorum, an early mediaeval re-enactment society with emphasis on accurately re-creating the past. She also tutors in the skill of writing historial and romantic fiction. She won a Betty Trask Award for The Wild Hunt and has been shortlisted for the RNA Awards four times.Chadwick's first, The Wild Hunt (1989), a cheerful early 12th- century adventure, featured that busy noble of the Welsh Marches, Lord Guyon of Ravenstow, blessed with political wits, warrior's skills, and a giant capacity to love and lust. Here, Guyon's foster son, Adam de Lacey, offers a reprise of all those good things as he handles some delicate missions for the totally untrustworthy Henry I of England, smites the enemy, and gentles the lovely Heulwen, daughter of Guyon by a deceased lass of lower degree (in Wild Hunt). Adam has just returned from escorting the furious widowed Empress Matilda, daughter of Henry I, back to England to be betrothed to some unlucky choice of Henry's. At home, Adam discovers that his foster sister Heulwen's husband has been killed and that she's now to wed (willingly!) thick-necked Warrin de Mortimer. Much sparring and evasions later, both discover a mutual love, and Adam sneaks Heulwen out of the marriage and lands himself a deadly enemy. From the Welsh Marches to the royal court and back again, the pair spat and mightily couple. Throughout, there are dangers and narrow escapes: hostages taken and released, a royalty- ordained trail-by-combat, and a ``melee'' featuring the nasty Warrin--his last dastardly act has posthumous consequences that threaten the marriage. All signs point encouragingly to a long, jolly series, which could run lightly through the Plantagenets--the first one here, Geoffrey, wed to the Empress Matilda. With action, bouncy sex, and believable historical figures: an easy-going companionable popular historical. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

While these buildings might stand as ghosts of the past today, their stories live on within these pages. The team behind BuildingsofDetroit.com brings you the memories of those who caught trains out of the majestic Michigan Central Station, necked with girlfriends in the balcony of the palatial Michigan Theatre, danced the night away at the Vanity Ballroom and kicked out the jams at the Grande Ballroom. As Detroit Free Press Architecture Critic John Gallagher said, the buildings in these pages held a central place in the story of Detroit&#39;s Auto Century. It was America&#39;s story, too. Detroiters lived, loved, toiled, played, celebrated and dreamed great dreams in these buildings and thereby helped shape a nation.&#34;</p><p>Dan Austin is a journalist at the Detroit Free Press and a historian of the city&#39;s landmarks. He began researching and writing about Detroit&#39;s architectural wonders in 2006. His first book, Lost Detroit: Stories Behind the Motor City&#39;s Majestic Ruins, &#34;? tells the stories behind the boarded-up windows of Detroit&#39;s most spectacular abandoned buildings. He runs HistoricDetroit.org.&#34;"Every building in Detroit has a story." And, thankfully, Dan Austin and Sean Doerr are the storytellers. ...

But the Master Inquisitor&#x2019;s plans to eliminate all traces of female power in the world have expanded to crushing the Sylvalan Barons who oppose him&#x2014;and to destroying the wellspring of magic in the Mother&#x2019;s Hills.<br><br>Faced with this evil, humans, witches, and the Fae become uneasy allies. But even together, they aren&#x2019;t strong enough to stand against the armies the Inquisitors are gathering. So they look for help from their last possible ally. The House of Gaian. The reclusive witches who rule the Mother&#x2019;s Hills. The witches powerful enough to create a world&#x2014;or destroy one...<br><br>Their long-held creed of &#x201c;do no harm&#x201d; is about to give way to more important one: <i>Survive</i>.</p><p><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author <b>Anne Bishop </b>is a winner of the William L.

She lives in upstate New York.Aiden studied her for a long moment. &#x201c;You could stay here with Ari and Neall. You don&#x2019;t have to go.&#x201d;<p>&#x201c;Of course I do. I&#x2019;m the Gatherer. I&#x2019;m Death&#x2019;s Mistress. My place is on a battlefield.&#x201d; Morag sighed. &#x201c;I should have killed the Master Inquisitor when I had the chance. Maybe things would be different now if I had.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; Aiden agreed. &#x201c;And maybe if you had, the battle would have come sooner, before we had any chance to meet it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I gave him a chance to leave, and to leave us be. I won&#x2019;t give him a second chance. I won&#x2019;t give any of them a second chance.&#x201d;</p><p>Aiden shifted uncomfortably. </p><p>None of the Fae except Ashk were comfortable with that aspect of her gift, but until last summer, it had been something that had been mentioned in old stories and songs. Unlike the other Fae whose gift made them Death&#x2019;s Servants, she could gather a spirit from one who was dying, not just from one who was already dead. And she could gather a spirit from someone who was very much among the living. She could ride through a village and leave nothing but corpses in her wake. It was one thing to know that was an aspect of the Gatherer&#x2019;s power; it was quite another to realize the person who wielded that gift was willing to use it.</p><p>And she would use it. Had used it. By the time she&#x2019;d found the Witch&#x2019;s Hammer last summer, she had killed all of the Inquisitors he&#x2019;d brought with him to Sylvalan. She&#x2019;d hoped that would convince him to leave Sylvalan and never come back, but that had been a foolish, futile hope. So the Gatherer would follow the Hunter into battle, and Death would be her weapon.</p><p>Morag brushed her black hair away from her face. Ashk and Neall were coming down the trail, both looking solemn. She turned away and walked to the large outdoor table where Padrick waited and she wondered if the Gatherer or the Hunter would be Death&#x2019;s true mistress in the days ahead.</p><p>Ashk studied the faces of the people sitting around the table. Padrick had asked to talk to just the Fae at this gathering since he would be meeting with the squires, magistrates, and captains of the guard at another time to plan the human defenses.</p><p>Good people, she thought as she studied them. Strong-willed people. </p><p>Aiden, the Bard, with his sharp mind and tongue and his passionate desire to protect the witches, the Daughters of the Great Mother. Lyrra, the Muse, whose gift nurtured the poets and storytellers. Morag, whose passion for life made her even more dangerous as Death&#x2019;s Mistress. Morphia, the Lady of Dreams and Morag&#x2019;s sister. Sheridan, the Clan&#x2019;s Lord of the Hawks, who had recently become Morphia&#x2019;s lover. Neall and Ari, who had changed the lives of many of the Fae around the table simply by being the people they were. And Padrick, Baron of Breton, gentry and Fae, Ashk&#x2019;s friend, lover, and husband.</p><p>Combined with the humans, would they be able to hold on to the things they held dear and to keep them safe?</p><p>Padrick unrolled a map of Sylvalan and placed a stone on each corner to hold it down.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard from two of the western barons,&#x201d; Padrick said. &#x201c;Despite Baron Liam&#x2019;s absence for the vote at the barons&#x2019; council a few weeks ago or, perhaps, because of his absence after his impassioned speech the vote went against all the decrees the eastern barons were trying to get accepted so that they would apply to all of Sylvalan. But there was no vote to demand that the eastern barons restore the rights of the women who live in their counties. Which leaves the people in those eastern counties at the mercy of the men who rule them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That is the human way, is it not?&#x201d; Aiden asked.</p><p>Ashk could hear the effort he was making to keep his voice neutral.</p><p>&#x201c;It is,&#x201d; Padrick said. &#x201c;A baron can rule as he pleases and do what he pleases. The decrees provide a standard we&#x2019;re all expected to honor, but no one is naive enough to believe every man with power wields it in the same way. However, this has left the eastern barons who sold themselves to the Inquisitors twisting in the wind, especially after the news that an entire village of women chose death for themselves and their daughters rather than live with the constrictions that had been put on them. The fact that the news traveled so swiftly and couldn&#x2019;t be contained has also changed things. Any eastern baron who had considered bringing in the Black Coats won&#x2019;t do it now, at the risk of having his own people turn against him. Those men can&#x2019;t be counted as allies, but they aren&#x2019;t enemies. At least, not yet. That leaves the rest of Sylvalan standing against the eastern barons who are controlled by the Inquisitors.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stalemate,&#x201d; Aiden said.</p><p>Padrick shook his head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so. If the Inquisitors had been willing to let us live as we choose, they never would have crossed the Una River. So I don&#x2019;t think a vote in the barons&#x2019; council is going to stop them; it will just change the way they attack.&#x201d; He ran his finger down the eastern side of the map, from the north down to the southern coast. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve been pushing steadily east and south, always pushing out from a place where a baron has reshaped his county to match the Inquisitors&#x2019; demands. From what I can tell, since their return this spring, they&#x2019;ve concentrated on destroying the witches to eliminate the magic in the Old Places. Or they did until Liam gave them another enemy to focus on.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t the only baron the Black Coats focused on,&#x201d; Ashk said softly.</p><p>&#x201c;No, he wasn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Padrick replied grimly. &#x201c;That was a mistake on their part. They may know of the Fae, but they don&#x2019;t know the Fae.&#x201d;</p><p>Ashk met Padrick&#x2019;s eyes for a long moment, then focused on the map. He was right. If the Black Coats had realized what kind of enemy they would awaken by attacking Breton and Bretonwood, they would have kept their distance.</p><p>&#x201c;You think they&#x2019;re going to attack the baron you helped?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>Padrick hesitated. &#x201c;I think if this Master Inquisitor is as intelligent and powerful as he seems, what he&#x2019;s going to focus on destroying is this.&#x201d; His finger landed heavily on the map.</p><p>&#x201c;The Mother&#x2019;s Hills,&#x201d; Ashk whispered, feeling a chill go through her.</p><p>&#x201c;As long as the House of Gaian rules the Mother&#x2019;s Hills, there will be witches. As long as there are witches, there will be vessels to embrace and channel the Great Mother&#x2019;s power and breathe magic into the world. As long as there is magic in Sylvalan, there will be the Small Folk and the Fae. So, yes, once he realizes those hills are the wellspring of magic in Sylvalan because of who rules there, he&#x2019;ll throw everything he can at those witches until he destroys them or until he and those who follow him are destroyed. And Liam, and the people of Willowsbrook, are standing squarely in his path.&#x201d;</p><p>Neall leaned closer to the map. &#x201c;Those hills cover a lot of land, and I doubt the eastern barons can gather enough men to form an army big enough to take them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If the Inquisitors control the barons of Wolfram and Arktos, and it seems likely they do, they can gather an army that&#x2019;s strong enough to be a real threat,&#x201d; Padrick said.</p><p>&#x201c;If they divide the army and have half swing below the hills to come up on the other side, they&#x2019;ll be attacking from both directions,&#x201d; Neall said.</p><p>&#x201c;So we block the way,&#x201d; Ashk said. &#x201c;Follow the curve of the hills to the south and north. If the barons who rule the counties there will stand against the Inquisitors with the help of the Clans in those areas, there would be no threat to the midlands or the western side of the hills, so the midland barons could send warriors to defend the gaps.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Assuming you can get enough of the Fae to help,&#x201d; Aiden said with a trace of bitterness.</p><p>&#x201c;If they want to spend time in the world, they can help defend the world,&#x201d; Ashk said coldly.</p><p>An uneasy silence settled around the table until Padrick finally cleared his throat. &#x201c;There might be another problem with the Fae&#x2019;s presence in those southern counties. I&#x2019;ve gathered that their . . . manners . . . haven&#x2019;t made the humans think well of them. The barons may not accept the Fae being among their people.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;d better accept it if they don&#x2019;t want to be outnumbered and crushed in a battle,&#x201d; Ashk snapped. Then she relented. She&#x2019;d heard enough over the years about how the Fae dealt with humans in other parts of Sylvalan to understand why the humans wouldn&#x2019;t trust the Fae, even to fight a common enemy. &#x201c;All right. We&#x2019;ll head for the southern end of the Mother&#x2019;s Hills first to convince the barons there to accept us as allies. Letters from you might ease things.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have them.&#x201d;</p><p>They talked for another hour, but it was more to confirm the things she and Padrick had already decided. A meeting of all the western barons would take place in Breton in a few days. Ashk had sent out the call to all the western Clans to have some of the huntsmen from each Clan join her. Now she&#x2019;d divide those men, sending some to the northern end of the Mother&#x2019;s Hills and some to the south and some would go to Willowsbrook. She hoped Baron Liam was as open-minded as Padrick thought. Based on what she knew about the Fae beyond the west, Liam and his people were about to meet something they hadn&#x2019;t seen before.</p><p>The meeting concluded, they&#x2019;d all risen to stretch their legs and get something to eat when Ashk noticed the woman standing far enough away not to intrude on their discussion, but just as obviously waiting for her attention.</p><p>As Ashk walked over to meet her guest, tension tightened her shoulders.</p><p>&#x201c;Blessings of the day to you, Lady Ashk,&#x201d; the woman said.</p><p>&#x201c;Blessings of the day, Gwynith,&#x201d; Ashk replied. &#x201c;Forgive my being blunt, but I&#x2019;ve a long journey ahead of me and much to do before I go. What brings you here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be heading for the midlands myself come morning,&#x201d; Gwynith said. &#x201c;I came down this way to tell you.&#x201d;</p><p>Ashk frowned. &#x201c;A Lady of the Moon doesn&#x2019;t need to tell me her plans to travel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I had to tell you. All the western Clans have heard the Hunter&#x2019;s call, and we&#x2019;ve heard about the Black Coats, so I had to tell you because I don&#x2019;t know how this might change what you need to do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dianna&#x2019;s power is waning.&#x201d; Gwynith frowned. &#x201c;No, not waning, exactly, but there&#x2019;s a . . . challenger . . . and those of us who share the gift of the moon are being drawn together to find out who will ascend to become the new Lady of the Moon and the Huntress.&#x201d;</p><p>Ashk said nothing for a moment. She didn&#x2019;t approve of Dianna or the Huntress&#x2019;s refusal to do anything to protect the witches and the Old Places, but at least she was a familiar adversary. A new Huntress . . . Gwynith was right. For good or ill, this could change things. &#x201c;Then I wish you well.&#x201d;</p><p>Gwynith shook her head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not the one. I feel the call, so I go to bear witness, and to offer my pledge of loyalty to the one who commands my gift. But I wanted you to know, if I have to choose between the Huntress and the Hunter . . . You need only ask, and I&#x2019;ll do whatever you need.&#x201d;</p><p>Knowing Gwynith could be stripped of her power if she defied whoever became the Lady of the Moon, Ashk said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hope you don&#x2019;t have to make that choice.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Baking Bad: A Parody in a Cookbook</h2><p><br>What do you do when the greatest TV show ever has come to an end and you no longer have ground-breaking, meth-related drama to get you through the long winter nights?

And for a long time, I felt like I was the only one.<br><br>But in truth, there are at least 50 million other Americans with an autoimmune disease. That's a LOT.<br><br>I'm sure that your experience is different than mine. But I also suspect that you might sometimes feel the same way as I have...<br><br><b>Frustrated and Helpless, Like the Medical System is Failing You</b><br>Modern medicine is amazing in so many ways. For instance, infant mortality is lower than ever. And you could break twenty bones and be fully recovered a year from now.<br><br>But modern medicine is not great at curing chronic illnesses like autoimmune diseases. And that's frustrating.<br><br>I visited doctor after doctor for many years, and they ran more tests than I can remember. But nobody ever off ered me a real solution to my illness.<br><br>At best, they prescribed me medication to treat and mask my symptoms. I don't blame any of those doctors. They didn't know what to do.<br><br>But I was constantly disappointed. And I've talked to a lot of people who feel the exact same way.<br><br>Fortunately, I found a way to heal my body without medication...<br><br><b>Real Food is the Key to Real Health</b><br>For as long as I can remember, I have loved eating.<br><br>And for most of my life, I loved eating junk food. After all, junk food is chemically designed to be addictive.<br><br>But once I started struggling to heal my body, something had to change. It was my change to Paleo and Real Food that made more difference than anything else. I hated being sick, but there was a silver lining...<br><br>Once I understood the impact of food on my body, I also learned to appreciate and love whole, fresh foods. Today, I eat better than ever, in terms of both health AND taste.<br><br>Better yet, I look forward to cooking, which was never the case when I was younger. Until recently, I viewed cooking as a chore that would take up what little time I had.<br><br>Today, I view it as a fun and exciting opportunity to create delicious food and make myself feel better.<br><br>And that's what I want to share with you and with the world...<br><br><b>A Love for Cooking, with a Little Perspective</b><br>I hated cooking for most of my life.<br><br>And for many years, I worked long hours as a lawyer in New York City. As you can guess, I had little desire or time to cook after getting home from a long day at the office.<br><br>So I understand completely that you may not look forward to cooking every day. And yet, I believe that everybody can learn to enjoy cooking. I believe that cooking can bring friends and family together like few other activities. And cooking does not need to be complicated or time-consuming.<br><br>Most of all, if you have an autoimmune disease, cooking is one of the most powerful things you can do to heal your body.<br><br>That's why I wrote this cookbook for a Paleo Autoimmune Protocol.<br><br><b>Healing Your Body Can Be Fun and Easy</b><br>Healing your body is not easy every single day. But it doesn't need to be a lifelong struggle. Getting well can also be much more fun than you think.<br><br>And getting better definitely starts in the kitchen. There are some amazing restaurants and great health-food brands. Still, 99% of restaurants and prepared foods are suspect at best.<br><br>If you're trying to heal an autoimmune disease, then almost all the food you eat needs to be cooked at home.<br><br>But that's hard if each meal takes you hours to prepare.<br><br><b>I Believe in Simple, Fast, &amp; Easy Recipes</b><br>It sounds silly, but I think most recipes should be simple, fast, &amp; easy. On special occasions, I sometimes choose to make complex and time-consuming dishes. On normal days, I don't have the time or energy to cook all day.<br><br>With just a couple exceptions, all recipes in this book are easy and quick to make. Plus, they turn out well each and every time.<br><br>Because if any one of those things isn't true, then cooking becomes much less fun. When that happens, you're likely to revert back to eating foods that don't heal or nourish your body.<br><br><b>Let's Build a Better Life</b><br>This is just a cookbook. But I also view it as much more than that.<br><br>I view this as an opportunity for you to dramatically improve your health and your life. A chance to take control of your body and feel younger, healthier, and happier.<br><br>Most of all, I view it as a tool for you to live a life that you love.<b>HEAL YOUR AUTOIMMUNE CONDITION WHILE EATING DELICIOUS AND NUTRITIOUS FOODS</b><br><br>We created the ESSENTIAL AIP COOKBOOK to help you succeed on a Paleo Autoimmune Protocol.<br><br>It includes only our best AIP recipes, including delights such as...&nbsp;<br><ul><li>Banana Pancakes&nbsp;</li><li>Orange Chicken&nbsp;</li><li>Arrowroot Battered Fish&nbsp;</li><li>Garlic CauliflowerNaan Bread&nbsp;</li><li>Hot "Chocolate"&nbsp;</li><li>Beets "No Tomato" Chili&nbsp;</li><li>Garlic Crackers&nbsp;</li><li>Vietnamese Beef Pho&nbsp;</li></ul>...plus over 100 other 100% AIP-compliant recipes.<br><br>And wherever possible, we've simplifi ed the recipes to make them easier and quicker, so that you can focus your energy on healing your body.<br><br><b>INSIDE THIS COOKBOOK, YOU'LL FIND</b>...&nbsp;<br><ul><li>115+ Recipes (All 100% AIP-compliant)&nbsp;</li><li>No Grains, Processed Foods, Legumes, Dairy, Nightshades, Nuts, Seeds, or Eggs</li></ul><b>THE ESSENTIAL AIP COOKBOOK MAKES GOING ON THE PALEO AUTOIMMUNE PROTOCOL LESS STRESSFUL</b><br><br>All the recipes are designed to be easy to make and delicious to eat - some are homey comfort foods while others are designed to impress.<br><br>100+ recipes for every meal from breakfast to desserts so you can answer the question, "What's to eat?" every time.<br><br>You'll also make familiar foods like pancakes, fall-off-the-bone ribs, chili, and crackers.</p><h2>Destiny, Freedom, and the Soul (Osho Life Essentials)</h2><p><p><b>One of the greatest spiritual teachers of the twentieth century shares his philosophy on self-discovery, free will, and the search for a place and purpose in life. </b></p><p><i>&#x201c;I myself am a question.

Early in his career, ahead of his time, he grew fascinated with identifying the biochemical root of manic depression, just as he began to suffer from it himself. By the time the results of his groundbreaking experiments were published, Dr. Baird had been institutionalized multiple times, his medical license revoked, and his wife and daughters estranged. He later received a lobotomy and died from a consequent seizure, his research incomplete, his achievements unrecognized. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mimi Baird grew up never fully knowing this story, as her family went silent about the father who had been absent for most of her childhood. Decades later, a string of extraordinary coincidences led to the recovery of a manuscript which Dr. Baird had worked on throughout his brutal institutionalization, confinement, and escape. This remarkable document, reflecting periods of both manic exhilaration and clear-headed health, presents a startling portrait of a man who was a uniquely astute observer of his own condition, struggling with a disease for which there was no cure, racing against time to unlock the key to treatment before his illness became impossible to manage.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifty years after being told her father would forever be &#x201c;ill&#x201d; and &#x201c;away,&#x201d; Mimi Baird set off on a quest to piece together the memoir and the man. In time her fingers became stained with the lead of the pencil he had used to write his manuscript, as she devoted herself to understanding who he was, why he disappeared, and what legacy she had inherited. The result of his extraordinary record and her journey to bring his name to light is <i>He Wanted the Moon</i>, an unforgettable testament to the reaches of the mind and the redeeming power of a determined heart.</p><p><b>Mimi Baird</b>, a Bostonian, is a graduate of Colby Sawyer College. &nbsp;After working at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, she later moved to Woodstock, Vermont, where she worked as an office manager at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center. There she met a surgeon who had once known her father, a meeting that prompted her quest to finally understand her father&#x2019;s life and legacy.&nbsp; Mimi has two children and four grandchildren.&nbsp; This is her first book.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Eve Claxton</b>&nbsp;was born in London. She has been instrumental in creating six works of non-fiction as a co-writer or ghostwriter, and is the editor of&nbsp;<i>The Book of Life</i>, an anthology of memoir.&nbsp;She also works with StoryCorps, the National Oral History Project featured on NPR. Eve lives with her husband and three children in Brooklyn.CHAPTER ONE<br><br>When my father's manuscript begins, he is forty years old and has lived with the diagnosis of manic depression for more than ten years. By now, he knows very well the symptoms of his disease, its dangerous, ecstatic highs followed by pitch-dark depressions. It is February 1944, and he has retreated to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Boston, as he often did when he felt himself becoming manic, in order to protect his family from his increasingly erratic behavior.<br><br>Although he had informed my mother that he was going to the Ritz to work on his book, he soon became distracted from his work. My sister, Catherine, and I stayed with our mother in Chestnut Hill, just outside the city, oblivious to events unfolding around us.<br>The morning of February 20, 1944, I slept deeply but awoke at the Ritz after only three or four hours of sleep, feeling that strange manic exuberance. I bathed, shaved and dressed, had breakfast, and then started out for a walk across the Boston Public Gardens. I ran short distances and leaped wildly over the broad flowerbeds. Anyone who might have seen me from the hotel would have thought my behavior a little unrestrained. I felt wonderful but restless, feverishly overactive, impatient. After walking for about ten minutes, I located a taxi and drove to my home in Chestnut Hill. I felt possessed with demoniacal energy. I was acutely manic.<br><br>When I arrived at my home, no one seemed to be there. I wandered around to the backyard and on impulse, climbed over the twelve-foot wire fence surrounding the deer park. I broke into a run. As I ran up and over an elevation of land in the deer park I saw a group of deer standing in the clearing. I wondered if I could run as fast as a deer and if I could catch one. I increased my pace by a sudden burst of speed. All of the deer except one turned and ran. This one deer stood her ground a few moments, wagging her funny little short white tail. Then she too turned and ran away. I hid behind a large boulder, and as the deer ran around in a circle they came past the boulder, and once again I tried to overtake them. The small herd of deer was led by a large stag that, as I jumped into his path, might have turned upon me, guided by his protective interest. Instead, he merely led his flock around me and they soon outdistanced me.<br><br>After wandering around the deer park for a while and finding all the gates locked, I climbed back over the fence and went into the back door of my house. I found Nona, our maid, sitting at a table, her head in the crook of her arm, evidently crying. She must have known I felt upset. I went through the kitchen hurriedly, going into the dining room and through the living room, then out the front door.<br><br>As I walked along without my topcoat or overcoat, I felt quite hot even though it was a rather cold day. The sun was shining brightly. I looked into the sun but was not dazzled by its glare. Soon, the sun changed its appearance. It was gradually transformed from a fuzzy ball of fire with a shapely outline into a round silver-like disc with a clear halo around it. I looked away from the sun and, as my eyes turned upon the snow in front of me, I could see smoothly outlined, deep yellow spots upon the snow.<br><br>Soon, I arrived at the home of my good friend, the psychiatrist Dr. Reginald Smithwick. I walked across his lawn; then I stopped at his living room window. As was usual for him on Sunday morning, he was sitting in his armchair by the side of the fire, working on tables and texts of a scientific paper. I knocked and, without waiting long, went in.<br><br>"Good morning, Reg," I said.<br><br>"Hi, Perry," he replied. "Come and sit down."<br><br>I sat on the sofa and then lay down for a moment. I cannot recall the context of our conversation, but I admitted that I was somewhat manic and spoke of a feeling of greatly augmented physical strength. Saying this, I rose from my position, walked across the room, and picked up a poker by the fireplace. It was an iron instrument with a shiny copper sheath.<br><br>"Just as an experiment, let me see if I can bend this poker into a figure eight or a bow knot," I said.<br><br>I started to twist the poker.<br><br>"Don't!" Reg said in a high-pitched and nervous voice, as if some important decision rested upon what was about to transpire. Paying little attention to what might have been interpreted as a very important warning, I went ahead and twisted the copper poker into the shape of a double circle.<br><br>I could see that Reg was a little upset.<br><br>"Will you call me a taxi?" I asked.<br><br>Obligingly he went to the telephone immediately and called me a taxi.<br><br>"Please take me to the Ritz hotel," I said to the driver.<br><br>As we drove to the Ritz, it seemed to me that the streets were singularly deserted for a fairly advanced hour of Sunday morning. When the taxi pulled up in front of the Ritz there was no other car in sight.<br><br>In the far corner of the lobby, one of my secretaries, Charlotte Richards, was waiting. I had called my office earlier and asked for someone to come. Charlotte seemed quite nervous.<br><br>We stepped into the elevator and went to my room. There was another luscious copper and iron poker by the fireplace. I picked it up and went into my steel-bending performance.<br><br>"I am the only one who would come," Charlotte commented. "The rest were afraid."<br><br>During the following two hours or so, I dictated large amounts to Charlotte, drank enormous quantities of Coca Cola, and smoked Kool cigarettes almost constantly. The waiter brought up Coca Cola by the dozen bottles. I believe that the combination of Coca Colas and Kool cigarettes aggravated my state of excitation. My thoughts seemed to travel with the speed and clearness of light. I dictated and talked continuously.<br><br>Why so much happiness in the manic state? Perhaps an ability to dwell upon only the pleasing phases of one's past experiences and current problems, combined with an ability to shut out disturbing considerations; the process of thought seems not only clear and logical but powerful and penetrating, features made possible by focusing all attention upon the major facts, leaving out distracting details. Perhaps the euphoria is also in part physiological in nature, representing a spastic sudden flushing of areas of the vascular-bed long idle but now overactive; the escape is a transition from long phases of inactivity to a state characterized by an easy and abundant flow of energy.<br><br>The phone rang in the bedroom. It was my wife, Gretta.<br><br>"Good morning, Perry, how are you?" she asked.<br><br>"Oh, just fine, dear," I replied. "How are you? I'm here giving some dictation to Charlotte."<br><br>"Dr. Lang wants you to call him," Gretta informed me.<br><br>At this point I should have had every reason to realize the hazardous nature of my position. A call from Dr. Lang--the superintendent of Westborough State Hospital--should have indicated the possibility of my return to that psychiatric institution, a prospect that had long filled me with a sense of miserable apprehension.<br><br>In my wallet, I had about six hundred dollars. I could have walked out of my room on the pretext of going to the drug store and could have managed to get out of the state. If I had done so, I might have saved myself months of grief and despair. But--by some cruel stroke of fate, by some strange absence of any sense of caution--I went right on with what I was doing, paying slight heed to the dark cloud hanging low over me.<br><br>At my request, Charlotte called Dr. Reg Smithwick and asked him to see whether he could get a room at Massachusetts General Hospital for a few days of careful chemical studies of blood and urine. There were no rooms available.<br><br>As I dictated to Charlotte, I began collecting urine specimens in empty Coca Cola bottles, placing the specimens on the window ledge to keep them cool. I recall that the output of urine was quite large and seemed to be controlled by thought and emotion. When pleasurable ideas came to mind, I could seem to feel my bladder filling up. But when I felt anxiety, the flow of urine seemed to cease. I wonder whether the renal arteries and arterioles were expanding and contracting under the influence of nervous stress and nervous relaxation.<br><br>During these activities I made occasional trips to the bathroom and rubbed olive oil into my skin and hair. For some weeks my hair had been exceedingly dry, so much so that it would not stay in place after being combed and showed a tendency to stick up in all directions. It looked and felt like straw. This condition had developed at the end of a three- or four-month period of time during which I had followed a successful weight-reducing program cutting out all butter. Though I had continued to consume cod liver oil capsules containing vitamin A, this source did not evidently replace the loss from omission of butter. I feel sure that I was suffering from real vitamin A deficiency.<br><br>My food arrived. I had ordered an enormous meal consisting of about six eggs, two steaks and other items. My behavior was certainly unrestrained, to say the least. Charlotte left.<br><br>Soon after, my wife Gretta arrived with the children. She remained standing and began to make preparation to leave almost immediately after arriving.<br><br>Our eldest daughter, Mimi, was standing near me.<br><br>"I want to stay with Daddy," she said.<br><br>Instantly, Gretta found some excuse for taking Mimi with her and they left. Gretta's final remark was that they were going to The Country Club to skate.<br><br>I went to the bar, consuming another Coca Cola. I decided to follow Gretta to The Country Club and went out to get a taxi. At The Country Club, I walked towards the skating pond, but I couldn't find Gretta and the children and so returned to the clubhouse. As I came to the door, they were just leaving.<br><br>"I'll come back for you," Gretta said.<br><br>"Don't bother," I replied.<br><br>Gretta left to go home; I remained to face the tragedy of a lifetime.<br><br>Inside the clubhouse, I sat on the large divan looking out over the racetrack and golf course, and ordered a Coca Cola. The large old majestic trees and vast expanse of snow-covered lawn that can be seen from the side of the clubhouse form a beautiful and restful view. Very few people were around. I went over and spoke to a few friends. One of them refused to have a drink with me. (Could he have known that I was trying to keep my promise to my psychiatrist not to drink?) He acted a little strangely. Later he departed.<br><br>I ordered a martini that I sipped slowly. At this stage of events other friends began to file in, including Storer Baldwin, who walked up to me in a friendly manner, shaking my hand.<br><br>"Hello," he said.<br><br>I rose and spoke to him.<br><br>"I hate you!" I added softly.<br><br>Storer looked at me in rather a strange manner.<br><br>"That's pleasant," he said.<br><br>I heard someone say that Storer had ordered tea. I looked over his way, and to my astonishment, he was sitting before the fireplace with a tray of tea and sandwiches before him and surrounded by his customary group of friends and their children.<br><br>As if in a trance, I walked over to Storer, and watched him drink tea. I looked around and said hello to some of my friends. I laid my half empty martini glass on Storer's tray and walked away.<br><br>The President of the Massachusetts Medical Society, Dr. Channing Frothingham, and his wife came into the room.<br><br>I sat down with Dr. and Mrs. Frothingham and talked with them for a few minutes. Dr. Frothingham invited me to have a drink with them and to eat with them. I felt greatly honored because I have always admired Dr. Frothingham. I recall discussing court tennis, at which Dr. Frothingham had been a world champion. I made some sort of a boast that I thought I could beat him (manic overconfidence). I hope the remark sounded humorous.<br><br>A boy came along and said that someone wanted me at the front. Completely innocent of the nature of this call, I walked out of the living room and down the corridor. I recognized plain-clothes policemen--three of them standing at the front desk near the telephone operator. By now, it was too late to retrace my steps. I walked into the midst of them and soon verified my suspicions: they had come to take me to Westborough State Hospital.<br><br>I knew that I needed help. I felt a desperate desire to escape the horror of returning to a psychiatric institution. I went to the club telephone booth and began to call my psychiatrist friends but they were not at home. I reached our family physician, Dr. Porter, and told him what was about to happen. I asked him to help me.<br><br>"It's up to you, my boy," he said.<br><br>What could he have meant by this statement?<br><br>I might have thought to call my lawyer, but I didn't. Finally I called Dr. Lang, Superintendent of Westborough Hospital.<br><br>"I think you'd better come on out," Lang said dryly.<br><br>I left the telephone booth.<br><br>"There's no hurry, Doctor," said the policeman in charge.<br><br>"Please excuse me," I replied. "I'd like to go back and speak to my friend, Dr. Frothingham."<br><br>I went back into the living room and found that Dr. and Mrs. Frothingham had gone into the dining room. I went to their table and drew up a chair.<br><br>"They have come to take me back to Westborough," I said in a voice that was soft but which must have betrayed my despair.<br><br>Mrs. Frothingham sat very quietly, saying nothing, but looking very tense.<br><br>I walked into the living room and found our Chestnut Hill neighbor, Helen Webster, sitting with a group of guests. To my own surprise I went over and sat close to her, placing my head on her shoulder. Her friends looked surprised. She rose immediately and took me by the arm.<br><br>Helen and I walked to the entrance to the men's bar and stood there alone for a moment.<br><br>"Will you kiss me, Helen?" I asked.<br><br>Helen came up to me and kissed me very softly on the cheek and left.<br><br>Dr. Frothingham and a group of Club members came down the hallway with the policemen.</p><h2>The Shadow Dancer (A Wind River Reservation Mystery)</h2><p>With the disappearance of a young man and his old friend Vicky Holden accused of murder, Father John O&#39;Malley must prove his hunch that both events are connected to a dangerous sect leader known as Orlando-who has resurrected the old Shadow Dance religion.</p><p>Margaret Coel is the <b>New York Times</b> bestselling, award-winning author of <b>The Thunder Keeper, The Spirit Woman, The Lost Bird, The Story Teller, The Dream Stalker, The Ghost Walker, The Eagle Catcher</b>, and several works of nonfiction. She has also authored many articles on the people and places of the American West. Her work has won national and regional awards. Her first John O'Malley mystery, <b>The Eagle Catcher</b>, was a national bestseller, garnering excellent reviews from the <b>Denver Post</b>, Tony Hillerman, Jean Hager, Loren D. Estleman, Stephen White, Earlene Fowler, Ann Ripley and other top writers in the field. A native of Colorado, she resides in Boulder.Skillfully combining the rich history of Native Americans with their life in the 21st century, bestseller Coel offers a fresh story that moves as fast as the moccasin telegraph, the reservation gossip line that spreads news faster than the Internet, in this eighth outing featuring Vicky Holden, Arapaho attorney, and Father John O'Malley, priest of the mission on Wyoming's Wind River Reservation. This represents a welcome return to form after last year's The Thunder Keeper, which suffered from an overly familiar plot. Father John is facing the possible closing of the mission and the sudden disappearance of one of his parishioners when Vicky's ex-husband is murdered and she becomes the chief suspect. Circumstances prompt Vicky to forgo Father John's assistance in her search for the killer, but as they go their separate ways, they each struggle to clarify their feelings for each other. In due course their paths cross at the ranch where James Sherwood, called Orlando by his followers, has resurrected the Shadow Dance religion of the 1890s. Can Sherwood deliver on his promise of an Indian paradise? Compared to and praised by Tony Hillerman, Coel not only presents a vivid and authentic picture of the Native American, past and present, but also captures the rugged and majestic atmosphere of Wyoming. Even minor characters are real and human. The poignant ending will catch even the most astute mystery aficionado by surprise.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dreaming of Stones: Poems (Paraclete Poetry)</h2><p>The poems in <b><i>Dreaming of Stones</i></b>&nbsp;are about what endures: hope and desire, changing seasons, wild places, love, and the wisdom of mystics.

Drawing on her commitment as a Benedictine oblate, the poems arise out of a practice of sitting in silence and&nbsp;<i>lectio divina</i>,&nbsp;in which life becomes the holy text.<br> &nbsp;<br> No stranger to poetry, Paintner&#x2019;s bestselling spirituality titles have often included poems. In this first exclusively poetic collection, she writes with a contemplative heart about kinship with nature, ancestral connections, intimacy, the landscape, the unfolding nature of time, and Christian mystics.

There, her thoughtful analysis of the foundations of modern society stretch the reader beyond any kind of idolatry of the present. Here, she goes even further in her commitment to wed vision to understanding. In this new work, she brings poetic insight to observation. She presents the flash of light, the kernel of truth that goes deeper and more mystically into the heart of the universe than fact and faith can hope to do. She makes a bridge for us between experience and wisdom and gives us a veritable holograph of life.&#x201d;<br> -<b>Joan Chittister, OSB</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;These are poems about things that really matter: the tides of time, the lure of landscape, our links to our forebears, our love of home.&nbsp;Paintner has a musical ear and an artist&#x2019;s craft with colour and texture.&nbsp;The work is lushly sensual in its language, generous in its patient wisdom.&nbsp;<i>Dreaming of Stones&nbsp;</i>is a collection you will want to keep near you, as a source of comfort and inspiration.&nbsp; Here, the profound is made warmly accessible; the ordinary made wondrous.&#x201d;<br> -<b>Susan Millar Dumars</b>, poet, author of&nbsp;<i>Dreams for Breakfast</i> and&nbsp;<i>Bone Fire</i><br><br> &#x201c;The sequences unfold like breath, a motif that holds the collection together.

She writes about our journeying to retrieve a lost intimacy with the world in poems sculpted as though from fine pieces of light: delicate things made beautiful for a road less travelled. More than anything I am drawn to poems inspired by the early Celtic saints of Ireland for whom nature and a God-created world were inseparable from faith. The stories they leave behind and the poems that tell them are pieces of wisdom for an age trying to travel too fast and too loudly.&#x201d;<br> -<b>Kenneth Steven</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>Coracle</i>,&nbsp;<i>Salt and Light</i></p></p><h2>The Message of John&#39;s Letters (The Bible Speaks Today Series)</h2><p>Immorality is inudating the Christian community and gradually eroding the foundations of Christian living. The truth of God incarnate, the atonement and the bodily resurrection of Christ are under attack--even from within the church. These are the concerns of Christians today, and they were the problems that faced the Christians of John's day. In a society that scorned the gospel and sneered at godly living, John encouraged Christians with a message forged from two words--<em>truth</em> and <em>love.</em> In this contemporary retelling of John's message, David Jackman describes John's first letter as an upwardly spiraling staircase that circles and broadens out around the twin themes of truth and love, mind and heart, Word and Spirit. It is a message both timeless and timely for the church today.</p><p>Jackman was the first director of the Cornhill Training Course. A respected Bible teacher in Britain, he is also the author of <em>Understanding the Church.</em></p><h2>Song of Achilles (P.S.)</h2><p><p>Achilles, "the best of all the Greeks," son of the cruel sea goddess Thetis and the legendary king Peleus, is strong, swift, and beautiful irresistible to all who meet him. Patroclus is an awkward young prince, exiled from his homeland after an act of shocking violence. Brought together by chance, they forge an inseparable bond, despite risking the gods' wrath. </p><p>They are trained by the centaur Chiron in the arts of war and medicine, but when word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped, all the heroes of Greece are called upon to lay siege to Troy in her name. Seduced by the promise of a glorious destiny, Achilles joins their cause, and torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus follows. Little do they know that the cruel Fates will test them both as never before and demand a terrible sacrifice."</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, March 2012</strong>: Betrayal, ardor, war, and prophecies--in <i>The Song of Achilles</i>, author Madeline Miller brings together everything I love about <i>The Iliad</i> without the labor of epic poetry. In this new twist on the Trojan War story, Patroclus and Achilles are the quintessential mismatched pair--a mortal underdog exiled in shame and a glorious demigod revered by all--but what would a novel of ancient Greece be without star-crossed love? Miller includes other good tragic bits--foreknowledge of death, ruthless choices that pit pride and reputation against the lives of innocents, the folly of men and gods--and through her beautiful writing my spine chilled in the presence of Achilles&#x2019; mother, the sea goddess Thetis, and I became a bystander in the battlefield of Troy awash with blood, exaltation, and despair. <i>The Song of Achilles</i> infuses the essence of Homer with modern storytelling in a combination that is utterly absorbing and gratifying--I can&#x2019;t wait to see what Miller tackles next. <i>--Seira Wilson</i> <br><br> <strong> Gregory Maguire Interviews Madeline Miller</strong><br> <p><strong> Gregory Maguire is the best-selling author of <em>Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister</em>, <em>Lost, </em><em>Mirror Mirror, </em> the Wicked Years, a series that includes <em>Wicked</em>, <em>Son of a Witch</em>, <em>A Lion Among Men</em>, and most recently, <em>Out of Oz</em>. </strong></p> <p><strong> Gregory Maguire:</strong> Ms. Miller, you write with the confidence of the zealously inspired, taking as your material one of the great foundation texts of world literature. In three millennia, <em>The Iliad</em> has garnered somewhat wider attention than <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, with which I have played, so I have to ask: where do you get the noive? How did you come to dare to take on such a daunting task, and for your first book?</p> <p><strong> Madeline Miller:</strong> A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and in my case it was just dangerous enough to get me started. If I had stopped to ponder, I think I might have been too intimidated. But it helped that Patroclus is such an underdog&#x2014;giving him voice felt like standing up for him. I had been intensely frustrated by a number of articles that kept side-stepping the love between him and Achilles, which to me felt so obviously at the story&#x2019;s heart. So I wanted to set the record straight, as I saw it.</p> <p><strong> Maguire:</strong> The novel tells the story of the rise, fall and immortalization of the golden Achilles. You approach his famous story from a sideline, that of Patroclus, his bosom companion and lover. Was it hard to keep the mighty arc of legend from overwhelming shadowy Patroclus, and did you write more of him than you ended up using, just to be sure you had him firmly grounded in your mind?</p> <p><strong>Miller:</strong> Definitely yes to the second. I actually spent five years writing a first draft of the novel, took a good long look at it, then threw it out and started from scratch. Even though not a word survived, that draft was an essential first step. It helped me understand the story and characters, especially Patroclus, from the inside out.</p> <p>As for the overwhelming legends, I actually think they worked in my favor&#x2014;because Patroclus is overwhelmed by them himself. He is this ordinary person who is pulled into a terrifying world of angry deities and destiny because of his love for Achilles.</p> <p><strong>Maguire:</strong> Having glancingly heard of this legend before, I knew more or less how it would end. I had no idea how you might handle the loss of perspective and point of view when tragedy would inevitably strike. You managed to narrate an almost impossible transition from life into myth in part, I think, by your instinctual use of a combination of present and past tense, to say nothing of a masterly combining of authorial and first person observations. How many slaughtered bulls did you sacrifice, and on whose altar, to deserve the talent to risk such dangerous technique?</p> <p><strong>Miller:</strong> It was a lot of bulls. And whatever ended up working, I give all the credit to my background in theater. When I first started writing, I had this idea that I should be in control of the story, forcing it forward. It never worked. What I needed to do was learn how to get in character, and write from there.</p> <p>It took me a long time to find just the right tone for the ending&#x2014;I kept writing and throwing away, writing and throwing away. Then, in the middle of apartment-hunting, inspiration struck. All the other ideas had started out well, but would gum up before they got anywhere near the finish line. But this one kept humming right along. And it was the simplest, so there you go.</p> <p></p> <p><strong> Maguire:</strong> Oscar Wilde said something like, &#x201c;The Odyssey was written by Homer, or another Greek of the same name.&#x201d; But Oscar Wilde had clearly not met you. This is not a question. It is a salute.</p>Madeline Miller has a BA and MA from Brown University in Latin and Ancient Greek, and has taught both for over a decade.

The first catalogues the various antecedents for Angelomorphic Christology&#x2015;Jewish speculation about principal angels, mediator figures, and related phenomena&#x2015;with chapters on "An Angelomorphic God," "Angelomorphic Divine Hypostases" (including the Divine Name, the Divine Glory, Wisdom, the Word, the Spirit and Power), Principal Named Angels, and Angelomorphic Humans. The book&#x2019;s second half examines the evidence for Angelomorphic Christology in early Christian literature. This portion begins with a brief overview of the principal Angel and Angelomorphic Christology from Justin to Nicea and then examines in turn the Pseudo-Clementines, the Shepherd of Hermas, the Ascension of Isaiah, the Revelation of John, the Fourth Gospel, the Epistle to the Hebrews, and the Pauline Corpus.</p><p>Gieschen argues that Christian use of the angelomorphic tradition did not spawn a new and variant kind of Christology, one that competed with accepted belief about Jesus for early Christians&#x2019; favor, but instead shows how Christians adapted an already variegated Jewish tradition to weave a single story about a common Lord.</p></p><p><p>Charles A.

At that time, many readers doubted the legitimacy of the new approach, whose key categories were the &#39;organized over-world&#39;, the &#39;state employing mafia methods&#39; and the &#39;adopted political family&#39;. Critics considered these categories metaphors rather than elements of a coherent conceptual framework. Ten years later Fidesz won a two-third majority in Parliament at the 2010 elections: the institutional obstacles of exerting power were thus largely removed. Just like the party, the state itself was placed under the control of a single individual, who since then has applied the techniques used within his party to enforce submission and obedience onto society as a whole. While in many post-communist systems a segment of the party and secret service became the elite in possession of not only political power but also of wealth, Fidesz, as a late-coming new political predator, was able to occupy this position through an aggressive change of elite. The actions of the post-communist mafia state model are led by the logic of power and wealth concentration in the hands of the clan. But while the classical mafia channeled wealth and economic players into its spheres of interest by means of direct coercion, the mafia state does the same by means of parliamentary legislation, legal prosecution, tax authority, police forces and secret service. The new conceptual framework is important and timely not only for Hungary, but also for other post-communist countries subjected to autocratic rules.</p><p>Balint Magyar is a liberal politician and independent sociologist</p><h2>The Lone Texan (Whispering Mountain)</h2><p>Three days after arriving in Galveston, newly widowed Sage McMurray finds herself taken hostage in a robbery.

The purpose of the book is to help the student to draw animals as he or she sees them. Noting and practicing the way Mr. Calder captures the emotions and attitudes of animals in a few quick lines, the student can quickly obtain a lasting groundwork in animal sketching that will before long become second nature. <br>These full-body sketches and enlarged details, in rapid, expressive brush-and-ink, of animals from the farm, the zoo, wildlife, and the home, in characteristic poses and movements, reveal both the action and portrait aspects of the art. There are 12 sketches of horses in action (drawing wagon or plough, racing, etc.); 10 drawings of cats, luxuriously asleep or alertly watchful, stretching or crouching; 14 drawings of dogs (many different breeds) in a variety of poses &#x2015; lying down, sleeping, sitting, running, sniffing the air, feeding puppies; 11 drawings of lions and other big cats, pacing, lying down, or crouching; 7 sketches of monkeys, jumping and gesticulating; 23 drawings of deer, stooping, sitting, running, etc.; 27 drawings of birds of many different species &#x2015; owls sitting, ducks waddling, etc.; and 18 sketches of cows grazing, sitting, swishing tails, and feeding calves. Also included are drawings of seals, elephants, squirrels, kangaroos, and a bear. <br>Because of the simplicity of Mr. Calder's approach to sketching, this book can easily be used by even the youngest of students. There are no difficult techniques to master here, no roundabout methods of construction, but just an insistence on drawing things as the student sees them, with undogmatic (and delightful) assistance from an undisputed master of the simple expressive line. It is unlikely that there is any more pleasant way to study such a fundamental branch of pictorial art. <br>Unabridged and unaltered republication of third (1929) edition.</p><p></p><h2>West from Singapore: Stories</h2><p>He&#x2019;s a two-fisted American adventurer and veteran of a hundred waterfront brawls.

At the time of the story the town of Gorontalo had a population of about six thousand&#x2014;a picturesque little port on the south side of a long peninsula. As in most of these small ports there was, aside from the local people, a certain number of drifters, adventurers, treasure hunters, ship&#x2019;s officers out of a job, and men tramping the island for one reason or another, most of them hoping to pick up an odd dollar here or there.<br> &nbsp;<br> John Russell has written well of these islands, and so has Somerset Maugham.<br> &nbsp;<br> EAST OF GORONTALO<br> &nbsp;<br> PONGA JIM MAYO leaned against the hogshead of tobacco and stared out at the freighter. His faded khaki suit was rumpled, his heavy jaw unshaven. The white-topped cap carried the label &#x201c;Captain&#x201d; in gold lettering, but Ponga Jim looked like anything but a master mariner, and felt even less like one.<br> &nbsp;<br> Being broke was a problem anywhere. In Gorontalo it became an emergency of the first water. Everything he owned in the world was on him, from the soft, woven-leather shoes on his feet to the white-topped cap to the big Colt automatic in its shoulder holster.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jim pushed his cap back on his head and glanced at Major Arnold, sitting on a bitt at the edge of the wharf. In his neat white drill and military mustache he could have been nothing but a British officer.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tell me, William,&#x201d; Jim said, &#x201c;just what brings a big-shot intelligence officer to Celebes? Something in the wind?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You get around a lot, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Major William Arnold lighted a cigarette and glanced up at Jim.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, when I can.&#x201d; Ponga Jim grinned. &#x201c;Right now I&#x2019;m on the beach, and it looks like I&#x2019;m not getting off for a while. But there isn&#x2019;t much in the Indies I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Arnold nodded. &#x201c;I know. You might do me some good, Jim. If you see anything suspicious, give me a tip, will you? There&#x2019;s a rumor around that while England&#x2019;s busy in Europe, there will be a move to pick up some of her colonies in the Far East. This is a Dutch colony, but we&#x2019;re cooperating.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then,&#x201d; Mayo said thoughtfully, nodding his head toward the broad-beamed, battered tramp freighter, &#x201c;you might add her to your list of suspects.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the Natuna out of Surabaya, isn&#x2019;t it? Didn&#x2019;t you used to be her skipper?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; Ponga Jim shifted his position to let the breeze blow under his coat. He was wearing a gun, and the day was hot. &#x201c;Then the company sold her to Pete Lucieno, and I quit. I wouldn&#x2019;t work for that dope peddler on a bet. I&#x2019;m no lily of the valley, and frankly, I&#x2019;m not making any boasts about being above picking up a slightly illegal dollar&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve made some of your British pearl fisheries out of season before now, and a few other things&#x2014;but I draw the line at Pete&#x2019;s kind of stuff.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No love lost, I guess?&#x201d; Arnold squinted up at Jim, smiling.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not a bit. He&#x2019;d consider it a privilege to cut my heart out. So would Dago Frank, that major-domo of his, or Blue Coley. And I don&#x2019;t fancy them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Major Arnold soon left, walking back up toward the club. Ponga Jim lighted a cigarette and stared thoughtfully at the Natuna. Then his eyes shifted to the other ship in port, a big white freighter, the Carlsberg. Although there were three or four schooners, and a scattering of smaller craft, it was the two freighters that held his attention.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Now, Major William,&#x201d; he said whimsically, &#x201c;you should never miss a bet. Being an old seafaring man, it strikes me as being somewhat phony for that native scow to be shoving herself around in circles. Especially, when she goes behind the Carlsberg riding high and comes out with darn little freeboard. Then she wanders around, gets behind the Natuna, and comes out riding high in the water again.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Now the only Carlsberg I ever knew sailed out of Bremen, not Copenhagen.&#x201d; Mayo&#x2019;s eyes flickered to the sleek white Carlsberg. &#x201c;So, putting a possibility of registry changed from Bremen to Copenhagen, some mysterious goings-on connected with the Natuna, a scow whose owners would frame their mothers for a dollar six-bits, a war, and William&#x2019;s rumors, what do you have?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ponga Jim Mayo straightened up and sauntered off down the dock. It was nearly sundown, and the seven guilders that remained in his pocket suggested food. After that&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> JIM WALKED INTO Chino John&#x2019;s and stopped at the bar.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Give me a beer,&#x201d; he said, glancing around. A man standing nearby turned to face Mayo.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, if it isn&#x2019;t my old friend Ponga Jim!&#x201d; he sneered. &#x201c;On the beach again, no?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jim looked at Dago Frank coolly and then past him at Lucieno. The fat little Portuguese glistened with perspiration and ill-concealed hatred.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Jim said. &#x201c;Anytime to keep out of the company of rats.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I disdain that remark,&#x201d; Lucieno said. &#x201c;I disdain it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better,&#x201d; Jim said cheerfully. &#x201c;If you took it up, I&#x2019;d pull your fat nose for you!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Dago Frank&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. He stepped closer.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then maybe you pull mine, eh?&#x201d; he challenged.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ponga Jim&#x2019;s right fist snapped up in a jarring right that knocked every bit of wind from Dago Frank&#x2019;s body. Then Jim jerked him across his knee. Unsnapping his belt with a deft twist of the fingers, he jerked down Dago&#x2019;s trousers, and while the raging man gasped for breath, proceeded to whip him soundly!<br> &nbsp;<br> Then jerking him erect, Mayo jolted another six-inch punch into his midsection and dropped him to the floor. Coolly, he picked up his beer and drank it, and then he turned and looked at Lucieno. The fat Portuguese began to back away, his face white.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jim grinned. &#x201c;Okay, pal,&#x201d; he said cheerfully. &#x201c;It was just a little lesson to teach your boyfriend to talk nice to his superiors. Next time&#x2014;&#x201d; He shook his finger warningly and turned away.<br> &nbsp;<br> Arnold was standing on the boardwalk as Jim strode through the swinging doors. He chuckled, clapping Jim on the shoulder.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That was great! Everybody in the Dutch East Indies has been hoping to see that pair get called. But you&#x2019;ve made an enemy, and a nasty one.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s just the fifth episode,&#x201d; Mayo said, shrugging. &#x201c;I beat them out of a cargo of copra and pearl shell down in the Friendly Islands about three years ago. About six months later they tried to kidnap old Schumann&#x2019;s daughter over in the Moluccas. They were going to sell her to some native prince. I put a stop to that, and a couple of their boys got tough.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What happened to them?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You know, William,&#x201d; Jim said seriously, &#x201c;I was trying to remember the other day. They had an accident or something.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> HE STRAIGHTENED HIS tie, and gave the automatic a hitch into a better position.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;By the way, William,&#x201d; he asked carelessly, &#x201c;where&#x2019;s the Natuna bound this trip?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;To Port Moresby, with general cargo.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ponga Jim walked down the street, and when he turned at the corner, glanced back. Major Arnold, his neat, broad-shouldered, compact figure very casual, was standing in front of Chino John&#x2019;s. Jim grinned, and turned the corner carelessly. Then, suddenly alert, he wheeled and darted down an alley, turned into a side street, and cut through the scattering of buildings toward the dock. The British Intelligence was convenient at times, at others, a nuisance.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was no one in sight when he reached the dock. He let himself down the piling and crawled into a skiff moored there in the dark. Quickly, he shoved off.<br> &nbsp;<br> Overhead there was a heavy bank of clouds. The night was very still, and the skiff made scarcely a shadow as it slipped through the dark water. Staying a hundred yards off, Ponga Jim avoided the lighted gangway and cautiously sculled the boat around to the dark side of the Natuna. There was no one in sight, so with painstaking care he drifted the boat nearer and nearer to the silent ship. When he came alongside he laid his paddle down and stood up, balancing himself.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fortunately, the sea was still. Picking up the heaving line lying in the stern of the boat, Mayo tossed the monkey&#x2019;s fist around a stanchion of the taffrail, and catching the ball, he pulled it down.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once aboard that ship he would be practically in the hands of his enemies and with no legal status. Ponga Jim grinned and settled the gun in its holster. Then taking two strands of the heaving line, he climbed swiftly&#x2014;hand over hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was no one in sight, and pulling himself through the rail, he rolled over twice and was against the bulkhead of the after wheelhouse. There was no movement aft. Forward, the light from a port glinted on the rail and the water, and he could see the watchman standing under the light near the gangway. It was Blue Coley.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jim crawled into the shadow of the winch and then along the deck to the ladder. The well deck was empty, so he slipped down. Then he hesitated.<br> &nbsp;<br> The passage was lighted, but it was a chance he had to take. The crew&#x2019;s quarters were forward, the officers&#x2019; amidships. There was small chance of anyone being aft. He stepped into the passageway and hurried along, passing the paint locker. The rope-locker door was fastened, and he swore as he dug for his keys. Luckily, he still had them. Once inside, he closed the door carefully and locked it again.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was a stifling smell of paint and linseed oil. He felt his way along over coils of line, until he stopped abruptly. Then, cautiously, he struck a match. The paint had been shifted into the rope locker. Carefully, he snuffed the match and then paused in indecision. Then he crawled over the coils of line and found the door into number five hatch. He grinned. Luckily, he knew every inch of the Natuna. He hadn&#x2019;t commanded her for a year for nothing, and he liked to know a ship. He knew her better now than the man who built her. She&#x2019;d changed a lot in twenty years, and there had been repairs made and some changes.<br> &nbsp;<br> The door was stiff, but he opened it and crawled into the hold, carefully closing the door after him. He was on his hands and knees on a wooden case.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Classical Music Fake Book (Fake Books)</h2><p>(Music Sales America).

Don DeFore earned a star on Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of Fame and was a household name in the 1950s and 60s. He co-starred in numerous feature films with many Hollywood legends, TV shows, and live theater.&nbsp; He is best known for "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" in which he played the next-door-neighbor, "Thorny," and his co-starring role as "Mr. B" in the 1960s TV series, "Hazel." The book includes much of Don's unpublished autobiography, "Hollywood-DeFore 'n After."<br> <br>"Growing up in Disneyland" is a metaphor for Ron's life growing up in a celebrity family filled with Fantasyland adventures he equates to a Forest Gump type life, from meeting the Beatles, Beach Boys, Led Zeppelin, and other celebrities as Associate Director of the Steve Allen Show. His nearly 20 careers include a mid-life crisis as the Flying DJ at an L.A. discotheque to political positions within the Reagan Presidential Administration to establishing his own company. "Growing up in Disneyland" is also to be taken literally, as Ron spent much of his youth in Disneyland where his father owned "Don DeFore's Silver Banjo Barbecue" restaurant in Frontierland. Ron and his brother, Dave, have given presentations to various Disneyland interest groups after which many attendees suggested, you should write a book.<br><br> "Growing up in Disneyland" will be enjoyed by any age group from baby-boomers that remember Don DeFore's many beloved acting roles to those that don't but are curious how life was in the good-old-days, especially growing up in a Hollywood celebrity family. Ron has had so many careers and adventures along the way that readers will have much to keep them from putting the book down.</p><p>I never thought I'd write a book.&nbsp; Although I became an accomplished writer and editor through my career in public relations, writing a book was just not on my bucket list.&nbsp; After twenty years of my brother David and I giving presentations to various Disney enthusiast groups including two at D23 (the bi-annual ABC-TV/Disney convention in Anaheim. CA) the number of people saying, "You should write a book" reached critical mass.I had titled our Disneyland presentations, "Growing up in Disneyland" because it was all about my Dad's restaurant in Frontierland, "Don DeFore's Silver Banjo Barbecue."&nbsp; We would begin with "Who was Don DeFore?" to put everything into context. "The Banjo" was the only concession in the Park to ever display the name of a real living person.&nbsp; This is because Dad was very good friends with Walt Disney.&nbsp; My book goes through the history of their friendship which started when Dad was president of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences and sold the first national broadcast of the Emmy Awards Show to NBC.&nbsp; Walt wanted to meet the guy that was able to pull that off.&nbsp; My book goes well beyond what we've squeezed into our 45 minute presentations.It was while I was on my semi-regular two-mile walk in the fall of 2017 that the decision to write a book came to me like a bolt of lighting and now being retired I would have the time to do so.&nbsp; The book would be about Dad's major accomplishments and my amazing life growing up around that and my own amazing career path.What's truly inexplicable is that I was a at least a month into researching Dad's various acting roles when I realized I had his entire autobiography on my computer.&nbsp; Duh!&nbsp; Why try to tell his part of the story when I could use Dad's own words?&nbsp; So the first part of the book is mostly his recollections and the remainder is my perspective growing up and moving through some twenty quite different careers and experiences."Don DeFore was one of those reliable actors who always delivered the goods, on both television and the big screen. I'm not surprised to learn that his peers thought enough of him to vote him President of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences."<br>-Leonard Maltin, American Film Critic and Historian<br><br>"Don DeFore's Silver Banjo Barbecue restaurant in Frontierland was very unusual as it was the only food facility in the Park to have the name of a living person.&nbsp; Walt obviously was good friends with Don and trusted him to sell a quality product in his park." <br>-Dave Smith, Chief Archivist Emeritus, The Walt Disney Archives<br><br>"Don DeFore was an extraordinary talent and played a pioneering role as one of the first straight men in sitcom television. As "Thorny, the ever-supportive neighbor, he helped round out the Nelson household.&nbsp;"&nbsp;<br>-Sam Nelson, son of Ricky Nelson and Kris Harmon (<i>The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet</i>)<br><br>"The 'news' pitches I got from Ron DeFore were often on the most mundane of subjects.&nbsp; I didn't mind, as he was Hollywood royalty to me. &nbsp;Judy Garland was matron of honor in his parents' wedding!

A prolific screenwriter, he was stricken with diabetes in 1955. Complications from the disease brought about his blindness in 1978 and, within two years, the amputation of both legs. He continued to write by dictation to his wife, Joyce, and published <em>Dreams from Bunker Hill</em>, the final installment of the Arturo Bandini series, in 1982. He died on May 8, 1983, at the age of seventy-four.</p>This is just as full of life as John Fante&#39;s novel of that title which came out - can it be - 25 years ago. . . full of life and death in affectionate synch and guessably based on a father who might have been the cussin&#39; image of Nicholas Molise, an old cock, a fighting cock of 76. Actually his wife has accused him of adultery and put him in the slammer which he refuses to leave, unvindicated. Nick has always been a tyrannical, vociferous &#34;dirty old goat&#34; - getting sloshed at the Cafe Roma and gambling all he earns as a stonemason, and more. Now he wants his oldest son Henry (the narrator, a writer) to come with him on one last job up in the mountains building a smokehouse; all his apprentices have long since died or defected. Henry can&#39;t say no but it will be the end of Nick who has a diabetic coma, splits the hospital, goes to a winery, and dies as he lived. In Chianti veritas, tears and a warm glow.

The Ashmolean holds the greatest collection of Raphael drawings in the world, and the Albertina is the custodian of a major collection including some of the most beautiful and important of the artist's sketches. Taken together, the two collections provide extraordinary resources that, amplified by carefully-selected international loans, will allow us to transform our understanding of the art of Raphael.<br><br>The Oxford exhibition is based on new research by Dr Catherine Whistler of the Ashmolean Museum and Dr Ben Thomas from the University of Kent, in collaboration with Dr Achim Gnann of the Albertina. It will take Raphael's art of drawing as its focus, with the concept of eloquence as its underlying structure. Oratory runs as a linking thread in Raphael's drawings, which stand out for the importance given to the study of gestures, facial expressions, and drapery. Moreover, Raphael treated the expressive figure of the orator - poet, philosopher, muse, apostle, saint or sibyl - in fascinating and significant ways throughout his life.<br><br>This selection of drawings demonstrates how Raphael created a specific mode of visual invention and persuasive communication through drawing. He used drawing both as conceptual art (including brainstorming sheets) and as a practice based on attentive observation (such as drawing from the posed model). Yet Raphael's drawings also reveal how the process of drawing in itself, with its gestural rhythms and spontaneity, can be a form of thought, generating new ideas. The Oxford exhibition will present drawings that span Raphael's entire career, encompassing many of his major projects and exploring his visual language from inventive ideas to full compositions. The extraordinary range of drawings by Raphael in the Ashmolean and the Albertina, enhanced by appropriate loans, will enable this exhibition to cast new light on this familiar artist, transforming our understanding of Raphael's art.<br><br>This book preludes a major exhibition, which will run from June to September 2017, with a range of events happening throughout this time.</p><p>Catherine Whistler is the Keeper of Western Art at the Ashmolean Museum, and is a leading expert on Old Master Drawings.</p><h2>The New Dealers&#39; War: FDR and the War Within World War II</h2><p>Acclaimed historian Thomas Fleming brings to life a flawed and troubled FDR struggling to manage World War II. Starting with the leak to the press of Roosevelt&#39;s famous Rainbow Plan, then spiraling back to FDR&#39;s inept prewar diplomacy with Japan and his various attempts to lure Japan into an attack on the U.S. Fleet in the Pacific, Fleming takes the reader on a journey through the incredibly fractious struggles and debates that went on in Washington, the nation, and the world as the New Dealers strove to impose their will on the conduct of the War. In bold contrast to the familiar, idealized FDR of other biographies, Fleming&#39;s Roosevelt is a man in remorseless decline, battered by ideological forces and primitive hatreds that he could not handleand frequently failed to understandsome of them leading to unimaginable catastrophe. Among FDR&#39;s most dismaying policies, Fleming argues, is his insistence on &#34;unconditional surrender&#34; for Germany (a policy that perhaps prolonged the war by as much as two years, leaving millions more dead) and his often-uncritical embrace of and acquiescence to Stalin and the Soviets as an ally. The New Dealers&#39; War is one of those rare books that force readers to rethink what they think they know about a pivotal event in the American past.</p><p>Always fiercely contested on matters of domestic policy, Franklin Roosevelt faced even more opposition when it came to international relations. His first two terms in office coincided with the rise of a powerful isolationist movement that urged the government not to involve itself in foreign entanglements. That movement, coupled with strongly anti-British sentiment that owed much to America's large Irish and German populations, hampered Roosevelt's efforts to set the nation on the side of England when it became apparent in the late 1930s that a European war loomed.<p> To placate his opposition, Thomas Fleming charges in <i>The New Dealers' War</i>, Roosevelt promised "that he would never send American soldiers to fight beyond America's shores." Yet, Fleming continues, on December 4, 1941, the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> revealed the existence of elaborate war plans involving the landing of an American force 5 million strong in Europe by 1943. The revelation gave isolationists fits, of course, but their criticism was effectively silenced three days later when a Japanese force attacked Hawaii. In declaring war on Japan and its allies, Roosevelt's New Deal administration imposed what Fleming considers to have been an unreasonable demand for the unconditional surrender of the Axis powers. That demand, he believes, compromised internal resistance to the enemy regimes. Its prosecution also legitimized the use of what Fleming calls "hateful tactics" such as the bombing of civilian targets and the use of nuclear weapons.</p><p> Fleming's revisionist study will be of greatest interest to those already inclined to the view that Franklin Roosevelt tricked his country into fighting Fascism. Other readers may take issue with his ad hominem, ideological arguments. Either way, his provocative thesis is sure to promote debate. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Thomas Fleming</b> is the author of more than forty books, including <i>The New Dealers' War, Duel</i>, and <i>Liberty! The American Revolution</i>, as well as best-selling novels about America's war experience such as <i>Time and Tide</i> and <i>The Officers' Wives</i>.

Men lying as still as if they were already dead. Men shaking with pain. One man raving, jabbering, yelling, in delirium. Everywhere bandages . . . bandages . . . bandages . . . and blood. <br><br>Those words describe the moment when Private John Lewis Barkley first grasped the grim reality of the war he had entered. The rest of Barkley's memoir, first published in 1930 as <i>No Hard Feelings</i> and long out of print, provides a vivid ground-level look at World War I through the eyes of a soldier whose exploits rivaled those of Sergeant York. <br><br>A reconnaissance man and sniper, Barkley served in Company K of the 4th Infantry Regiment, a unit that participated in almost every major American battle. The York-like episode that earned Barkley his Congressional Medal of Honor occurred on October 7, 1918, when he climbed into an abandoned French tank and singlehandedly held off an advancing German force, killing hundreds of enemy soldiers. But Barkley's memoir abounds with other memorable moments and vignettes, all in the words of a soldier who witnessed war's dangers and degradations but was not at all fazed by them. <br><br>Unlike other writers identified with the "Lost Generation," he relished combat and made no apology for having dispatched scores of enemy soldiers; yet he was as much an innocent abroad as a killing machine, as witnessed by second thoughts over his sniper's role, or by his determination to protect a youthful German prisoner from American soldiers eager for retribution. This Missouri backwoodsman and sharpshooter was also a bit of a troublemaker who smuggled liquor into camp, avoided promotions like the plague, and had a soft heart for mademoiselles and frauleins alike. <br><br>In his valuable introduction to this stirring memoir, Steven Trout helps readers to better grasp the historical context and significance of this singular hero's tale from one of our most courageous doughboys. Both haunting and heartfelt, inspiring and entertaining, <i>Scarlet Fields</i> is a long overlooked gem that opens a new window on our nation's experience in World War I and brings back to life a bygone era.</p><p>Steven Trout chairs the English Department at the University of South Alabama in Mobile.

It has an elegant layout featuring ornamental lettering, watermarks, and gorgeous photos; were it not for the delightfully exuberant text, it would be a stately coffee table book. But kids will giggle about the central role of scat or, as Montgomery often writes, "poo," in the research of snow leopards' habits. Children will be swept up in the buoyant account of the journey through Mongolia led by Tom McCarthy, conservation director of the Snow Leopard Trust, in search of the elusive cat known as the "ghost of the mountain." He has devoted much of his life to studying these animals and persuading their human neighbors of the importance of their survival. Montgomery's enthusiasm translates well to the page and will have readers cheering for the entourage as they attempt to spot a snow leopard. This slender book abounds with information, including stories of McCarthy's rare, powerful past encounters with the cat, as well as zoological and cultural sidebars. Bishop's trademark stunning photography fills out the book with breathtaking views of the extreme environs of Central Asia and warm portraits of the charming people who live there. Author's and photographer's notes aren't typically as engaging as the main text, but the reflections of Montgomery and Bishop on their experiences with McCarthy's crew are eloquent, integral parts of the book. A great way to learn about a spectacular animal and its habitat.&#x2014;<i>Alyson Low, Fayetteville Public Library, AR</i> END</p><h2>Jerusalem Vigil The Zion Legacy: Book One</h2><p>"For fast-paced, often riveting action, the Thoenes come through with scenes of horror and fear that rival those of James Michener." --<b>The New York Post</b> <p><b>Bodie and Brock Thoene</b>'s superb storytelling comes alive in <b>Jerusalem Vigil</b>, a novel of the struggle for Jerusalem. It is May 14, 1948, in the world's holiest city: today the new State of Israel will be proclaimed and British troops will hand over the key to Zion Gate leaving behind hostile Jewish and Muslim forces poised for battle. Caught up in this historic moment are Moshe Sachar, an archaeology professor who is also a strategist; his pregnant wife, Rachel, who flees Tel Aviv for Jerusalem via a perilous route through the Christian Quarter; and Daoud and Gawan, two orphaned Arab boys who find a father with an unlikely surname. In this engrossing page-turner, the Thoenes combine historical authenticity, unforgettable characters, and gripping drama to create a saga about a fascinating period in world history.</p></p><p><i>Jerusalem Vigil</i> is the first novel in a planned <i>Zion Legacy</i> series that will chronicle three millennia of Jerusalem's history. Authors Bodie and Brock Thoene, whose <i>Zion Chronicles</i> and <i>Zion Covenant Series</i> have sold more than 6 million copies, write with the suspenseful flair of Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim LaHaye, and convey the historical knowledge of authors like James Michener and Herman Wouk. <i>Jerusalem Vigil</i> unfolds over a period of five days during the British withdrawal from Jerusalem in 1948. Its Jewish, Christian, and Arab characters (including Holocaust survivors, British military officials, and Arab insurgents) find themselves drawn into a mysterious and violent tangle of events that can only be understood in reference to ancient prophesies, particularly those of the book of Isaiah. The historical detail of this book is impressively deep, and its use of Scripture is always clever and surprising.<b>Bodie</b> and <b>Brock Thoene</b>, with degrees in creative writing and history, respectively, are the authors of <b>Jerusalem Vigil</b> and <b>Thunder from Jerusalem</b>, the first two volumes of the <b>Zion Legacy</b> series. Their other thirty-three novels include the best-selling series the <b>Zion Chronicles</b> and the <b>Zion Covenant</b>.

He lives in Northern California.<p> </p><p><b>Featured Excerpt in Penguin iPhone App</b></p><b> <p><b>Chapter One</b></p> <p>The day he found the body, Mickey Dade woke up under a tree on Mount Tamalpais.</p> <p>Sleeping outside a few nights a week had been going on as a regular thing with him for about four months now. He always kept a sleeping bag in his used Camaro's trunk anyway, and starting around mid-May, when the weather got nice everywhere but in San Francisco proper, he'd finish work and leave town in whatever direction struck his fancy. </p> <p>Even in the urbanized, over-crowded Bay Area, there were innumerable places a guy could simply pull over, park, and crash on the ground under cover of trees or bushes or in the hollow of a sand dune in one of the city or county or even national parks, at the beaches, off back roads, even in the quiet "neighborhood watch" suburbs. </p> <p>Monday the past week, while it was still light out he'd driven down to Woodside, an exclusive semi-rural enclave nestled into the foothills behind Palo Alto, and slept out under an old stone bridge over a dry creek bed. Two days later, he'd driven a couple of hundred feet down an unnamed, little-used dirt track cut into the woods behind Burlingame around Crystal Springs Reservoir. Last night, he'd gone north into Marin County, got halfway up Mount Tamalpais and pulled under an old low-hanging scrub oak in a forgotten and unpaved parking lot.</p> <p>He always woke up at first light, so this morning he was on the Golden Gate Bridge by the time the sun cleared the hills behind Oakland. He had his iPod coming through his speakers. It was mid-September and, as usual this time of year, the coastal fog was taking a break. The morning clarity under the cloudless sky was startling. Mickey could easily make out the tiny dots of the Farallons twenty some miles away over the deceptively still Pacific. </p> <p>He exited the bridge and soon found himself on Marina, cruising through the streets. The closely-set, well-maintained, beautiful low-rise homes stirred some vestigial gene he must have picked up somewhere. Just driving through a neighborhood of real honest-to-God stand-alone homes always filled him with something like contentment, although it wasn't quite that; it was more like hope that contentment and physical security was one of life's possibilities. </p> <p>This was something Mickey didn't have much personal experience with. He couldn't remember ever living in anything but an apartment house, although, his parents had apparently rented a small bungalow in the Sunset before their divorce. His sister Tamara said she vaguely remembered that house. But she was two years older than he was. Mickey had been only two when his mom had taken them from their father and moved out.</p> <p>But Mickey didn't get time to enjoy the Marina architecture this morning. A crowd was clogging the street up by the Palace of Fine Arts...; At this location, he thought somebody was probably shooting a movie&#x2014;the Palace had been a setting in both <i>Vertigo</i> and <i>The Rock</i>, among a host of other films. People loved the old domed structure that had been constructed for the Panama-Pacific Exhibition back in 1915. With its classical columns and its reflecting lagoon, the spot conjured both urban elegance and a hint of mystery. So he pulled into the Yacht Club parking lot, where he knew you could always get a spot at this time of the morning.</p> <p>When Mickey got out of his car, he was surprised that the noises carrying from down by the Palace seemed distinctly ominous and angry. Someone was giving harsh orders on a bullhorn. He heard a full-throated chorus of discontent&#x2014;maybe actors and extras emoting, but he didn't think so. </p> <p>Mostly, it sounded like a fight.</p> <p>*</p> <p>From the outskirts of the crowd, Mickey could make out at least three distinct groups, not including the vans from two of the local television stations. </p> <p>The police, at least twenty of them, six of them mounted on horseback, held a line near the shoreline of the lagoon. The non-equestrian cops were turned out in "hats and bats" -- full assault gear, helmets with tinted facemasks, batons out. A larger homogeneous and clearly hostile group of maybe fifty citizens milled around on the sloping banks of the lagoon as if waiting for instructions to charge the police line. In front of them, a tall bearded guy in camo gear was right up in the face of the lead cop with the bullhorn. Finally, down by the water's edge, a smaller group of perhaps twenty people in the uniforms of the city's Parks and Recreation department huddled fearfully by a small fleet of rowboats laden with what looked like netting of some kind.</p> <p>The camo guy started a chant, "Hell, no, don't let them go!" and in seconds the crowd was in full throat behind him, pressing forward toward the police line. The cops brought up their batons as the bullhorn exhorted the crowd to "Back away! Back away!"</p> <p>"Hell, no, don't let them go!"</p> <p>A white-haired man in a bathrobe and tennis shoes with his arms crossed and wearing a bemused expression stood on a lawn across the street. Mickey sidled up next to him. "What's going on?" he asked.</p> <p>The man shook his head. "Idiots."</p> <p>"Who?"</p> <p>"All of &#x2018;em."</p> <p>"But what's it about?"</p> <p>The man looked over, askance. "You don't know about the ducks? Where you been?"</p> <p>"What about the ducks?"</p> <p>"They're moving 'em, or trying to." He shook his head again. "Lunatics. Stupid idea, bad planning, insane timing. But what else do you expect nowadays, huh? You really don't know about this? Moving the ducks down to Foster City?"</p> <p>"Ahh." So that's what this was. Mickey had read all about it over the past few months, but hadn't realized that it was coming to a head so soon. Now the whole story came back to him. </p> <p>The city had approved a $22 million restoration for the Palace and its grounds, and part of that project included buttressing the remainder of the shoreline of the lagoon, most of which was already bounded by a low rock-and-concrete wall. But the rest of the shoreline, closest in toward the Palace itself, had become degraded over time&#x2014;in the past year alone, a couple of kids had fallen in when the banks had collapsed under them. It wasn't so much dangerous as it opened the city to possible litigation issues, and so the supervisors had given the plan the green light, and put up $7.5 million to get the project started. The rest would, somehow, be funded by private benefactors. And lo, it had come to pass. </p> <p>But to do any of this work, first the lagoon had to be drained.</p> <p>Enter the ducks. And the San Francisco Palace Duck Coalition. And a former Berkeley tree sitter who, for the present campaign, had adopted the <i>nom de guerre </i> of Eric Canard. Mickey only now came to recognize the man in his camo gear. Usually he did photo ops in a full duck suit.</p> <p>The Palace ducks, of course, along with its swans, herons, seagulls and other birds, called the lagoon home. And if the lagoon were drained, Canard had argued to the Board of Supervisors, they would become homeless. Temporarily, but truly. And in a city that prided itself on being a haven to the homeless, this was simply unacceptable. </p> <p>So the supervisors, caving in -- to widespread derision in the media and on the street -- had set about finding a solution to the problem. In spite of the fact that San Francisco had several nice and completely serviceable ponds, those ponds had their own populations of ducks whose environments, Canard argued, would be compromised by the wholesale relocation of the Palace ducks to their own home waters. So, eventually, the decision was made to relocate the ducks to Foster City, a residential community with Venice-like canals, and few permanent resident ducks, twenty miles south down the Peninsula. </p> <p>This would have been a workable though of course still wildly foolish idea except for one thing: six months before, Foster City had encountered its own problem with its indigenous ground squirrel population. These animals were burrowing in the city's levees and destroying them, threatening homes with the very real possibility of imminent flooding. In response to this crisis, Foster City had decided to poison the levee-dwelling critters en masse. This slaughter passed largely unnoticed in Foster City itself, but did not escape the keen eye of Eric Canard. And when San Francisco announced its intention to remove its Palace ducks to Foster City, Canard had gone ballistic. </p> <p>Surely, if the ducks were sent to Foster City, the heartless bureaucrats there would not treasure and protect them. These people had shown their true colors around the plight of defenseless animals and would obviously treat the ducks as they had treated their own squirrels if given half a chance. And Canard was not going to let that happen.</p> <p>So he'd sued. And lost.</p> <p>And had threatened to sue again. Which gave the city a window in which to make its move.</p> <p> Across the street, the chant was wearing down, but Mickey could still hear a strong voice&#x2014;undoubtedly Canard&#x2014;yelling now at the lead cop.</p> <p>"So how'd this start today?" he asked. "I thought it was still in the courts." </p> <p>"No. The brains down at City Hall decided they'd just go ahead and round up the birds. The whole thing is nuts. And it's all moot anyway. They started draining the lake a couple of days ago before they were ready for the ducks&#x2014;in secret, I might add, and that's never a good idea&#x2014;so word got out to Canard and his people that something was happening down here, and the whack jobs started gathering before sunrise this morning. Uh oh."</p> <p>Off in the...</p></b></p><h2>Detective Gordon: A Case for Buffy</h2><p><p>The final story in this big-hearted series takes on the most important case ever investigated in Detective Gordon's forest&#x2015;where is Buffy's mother?

Besides teaching them the principles and practices of policing, the detectives take them on a case: Buffy's search for the family she had forgotten after a 'ghastly catastrophe.' Written with empathy, precision, and wit, the latest volume in the Detective Gordon series fills in Buffy's backstory while sending the characters on <strong>an adventure that young readers (and prereaders lucky enough to hear it read aloud) will enjoy. </strong>Colorful illustrations capture the story's scary moments and cozy details, right down to the last little cake."&#x2015;<em>Booklist</em><br></p> (<i>Website</i>)<br><br><p>"A very personal case for the detectives of the sweet little police station in the forest. Detective Buffy (a young mouse) and Detective Gordon (an old toad) handle nice, small cases like lost scarves and naughty, littering children in their forest district. When two students from the local kindergarten, a baby toad and a baby mouse, come to train as 'small police,' they mention their mothers so often that Buffy becomes sad. She doesn't remember hers. Detective Gordon encourages her to write poetry to remember, and her verse leads to memories of her past. The four head out to Cave Island to discover what happened to Buffy's newly remembered mother and siblings. The island is across a mountain and, of course, a bit of water&#x2015;and there is a fox there to deal with . . will he eat the police? Nilsson's fourth case for kind, wise (and tired) Detective Gordon and his cake-loving mouse protï¿½gï¿½e is no less charming than its predecessors.

The toad-and-mouse pair's peaceful routine&#x2015;their police work consists mostly of educating citizens to be kind to one another&#x2015;is interrupted when Buffy suddenly realizes something catastrophic: before coming to the forest, she had been separated from her mother and her many mouse siblings and doesn't know their fate. Accompanied by two small volunteers, young toad Sune and young mouse Gertrude, the detectives set off on an urgent mission to Cave Island (Buffy's now-remembered home), solve the case, and reunite Buffy with her family. The adventure moves along briskly&#x2015;with clues to unravel, a hungry Fox to reckon with, etc.&#x2015;but deeper issues permeate the story, from the first pages to the last. How does Sune come up with where Buffy's family is hiding from Fox? He makes a poem to clarify his thinking. (As Detective Gordon says: 'Maybe you can catch a thought that is inside you.') What is the best action to take if one finds a hedgehog sleeping in the middle of a path? The young ones decide to wake her up and help her find a better place to sleep. ('Bravo . . .

By focusing on Buffy's origin story, Nilsson deepens the series, which has already covered such meaningful themes as intergenerational friendship and bullying. This volume gently explores concepts like trauma, as when Buffy remembers the stressful circumstances under which she was separated from her entire family. There are a few loaded asides from Gordon that reinforce harmful forms of real-world bias ('Maybe mice could leave their families and think no more about them. You couldn't assume that everyone was like a completely ordinary toad'). This detracts from an otherwise thoughtfully crafted plot in which Gordon and Buffy learn from their younger sidekicks and Gordon acknowledges his own power. Spee's illustrations skillfully capture tender scenes along with spots of chuckle-worthy moments. VERDICT <strong>The charming pastoral setting, Gordon's wry antics, and Buffy's heartfelt journey will provide much comfort to fans of the series, especially on rainy days or before bed.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>School Library Journal</em> </p> (<i>Journal</i>)</p><h2>Come, Lord Jesus (Rekindling the Inner Fire)</h2><p>Late in the fourteenth century, Thomas ï¿½ Kempis joined a powerful spiritual movement sweeping Europe that was known as &#34;The Brothers of the Common Life.&#34; While plagues devastated the population and turmoil tore apart the Church, the Holy Spirit moved across the continent among everyday people, bringing thousands together in small communities to recreate the communal life of the early believers.

The author chooses as his starting-point the invasion of Italy by France in 1494, which sowed the dragon&#39;s teeth of all the successive European wars; the French invasion was to accelerate the trend towards new armaments and new methods of warfare. The author describes the development of the handgun and the pike, the use and style of staff-weapons, mace and axe and war-hammer, dagger and dirk and bayonet. He shows how armour attained its full Renaissance splendour and then suffered its sorry and inevitable decline, culminating in the Industrial Revolution, with its far-reaching effects on military armaments. Above all, he follows the long history of the sword, queen of weapons, to the late eighteenth century, when it finally ceased to form a part of a gentleman&#39;s every-day wear. Lavishly illustrated.

CLASSIC ARMS &amp; MILITARIA</p><h2>The Forbidden</h2><p><b>From the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the This Man series comes a "brave, cutting-edge romance" (<i>Library Journal</i>) that begs the question: what would you do if you fell in love with someone you can't have? </b><br>Annie has never experienced the "spark" with a guy -- the kind of instant chemistry that steals your breath and blindsides you completely. Until a night out with friends brings her face to face with the wickedly sexy and mysterious Jack. It's not just a spark that ignites between them. It's an explosion. Jack promises to consume Annie, and he fully delivers on that promise.<br><br>Overwhelmed by the intensity of their one night together, Annie slips out of their hotel room. She is certain that a man who's had such a powerful impact on her and who could bend her to his will so easily, must be dangerous. But she's already in too deep. And Jack isn't only dangerous. He is forbidden.</p><p>Jodi Ellen Malpas was born and raised in the Midlands town of Northampton, England, where she lives with her two boys and a beagle. She is a self-professed daydreamer, a Converse and mojito addict, and she has a terrible weak spot for alpha males.

Her novels have hit bestseller lists for the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>USA Today</i>, <i>Sunday Times</i>, and various other international publications and can be read in more than twenty-four languages around the world."A brave, cutting-edge romance...This is a worthwhile read."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Library Journal </i>on <i>The Forbidden</i></i></b><br><br>"<i>The Forbidden</i> is a gut-wrenching tale full of passion, angst, and heart!

It covers all the basic elements of this ancient discipline and philosophy of India&#x2014;including Yoga poses, diet, breath control, meditation, mantras, Kundalini energy, and more. It also includes newly translated excerpts from the scriptures and pays special attention to branches of Yoga, such as Tantra, that are of great interest to Western students but are frequently misunderstood.</p><p>Georg Feuerstein, PhD, (1947&#x2013;2012) is internationally respected for his work on Yoga and is the author of over fifty books.

Lisa Marie Cacho forcefully argues that the demands for personhood for those who, in the eyes of society, have little value, depend on capitalist and heteropatriarchal measures of worth.</p><p>With poignant case studies, Cacho illustrates that our very understanding of personhood is premised upon the unchallenged devaluation of criminalized populations of color. Hence, the reliance of rights-based politics on notions of who is and is not a deserving member of society inadvertently replicates the logic that creates and normalizes states of social and literal death. Her understanding of inalienable rights and personhood provides us the much-needed comparative analytical and ethical tools to understand the racialized and nationalized tensions between racial groups. Driven by a radical, relentless critique, Social Death challenges us to imagine a heretofore &#x201c;unthinkable&#x201d; politics and ethics that do not rest on neoliberal arguments about worth, but rather emerge from the insurgent experiences of those negated persons who do not live by the norms that determine the productive, patriotic, law abiding, and family-oriented subject.</p></p><p><b>Lisa Marie Cacho</b> is Associate Professor of Latina/Latino Studies and Asian American Studies, with affiliations in Gender and Women&#x2019;s Studies and English, at the University of Illinois, Urbana- Champaign."Even though this book is just being published, I have been telling people to find Lisa Marie Cachos work and read it for years. She has a rare ability to illuminate the collisions and erasures of identity, and she powerfully explains how their devastating consequences are the grounds for social order. This is a game-changing book, written in beautiful and lucid prose." (Rachel Buff,University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee)<br><br>"Cacho is basically right in her assessment of death and devaluation, especially under the slanted promises of liberal democracy and national consciousness[A]profound way to think about freedom." (<i>Women' Studies Quarterly</i>)<br><br>"Apowerful analysis of comparative racialization. As a text that painstakingly details the contemporary circumstances by which race attributes value to certain lives while denying it to others, Social Death will be one of those books that we come back to over and over again." (Roderick A.

Kutch is a resident of Michigan City, Indiana.Introduction&nbsp;<br><br> From the first time I picked up a colored pencil in my local art league class, I have been intrigued by the medium. More than two decades have passed since that course, and I have embraced the growth of colored pencil as a fine art medium with great enthusiasm. Since my first book, <i>Drawing and Painting with Colored Pencil,</i> was published by Watson-Guptill in 2005, there have been many product and technique developments. With a spirit of fun and adventure, I have incorporated new pencils, wax pastels, tools, and approaches into my own art. Whether I drew, brushed, grated, spattered, or even blew pigment through a screen, it has been an enjoyable and satisfying experience. In recent years, many new varieties and types of colored pencils have emerged, each with their own merits and characteristics&#x2014;and sometimes inspiring new techniques. The varieties of pencils and the palette of colors in which they&#x2019;re available have grown beyond wax- or oil-based &#x201c;permanent&#x201d; traditional pencils. Water-soluble drawing products now include new types of watercolor pencils, including ink-like pencils and even tinted aquarelle graphite pencils. Pigments are rich and dense, and more emphasis has been placed on lightfastness for the permanence of one&#x2019;s art.<br><br> The emergence of water-soluble wax pastels&#x2014;which may <i>look</i> like crayons but which offer much more in terms of quality, speed, and versatility&#x2014;has been perhaps the most surprising development in the world of color drawing and painting. Aquarelle wax pastels swiftly cover large areas with rich pigment that dissolves instantly with the sweep of a damp brush. The wax pastel can also be sharpened to a point, or the pigment can be stroked from the tip with a wet brush. This type of aquarelle wax pastel can yield a highly pigmented liquefied wash which can then be applied with a brush.&nbsp;<br><br> New and diverse drawing and painting surfaces that are colored pencil&#x2013;compatible have emerged, too. <br><br> Longtime favorite lines of paper have expanded to include more colors. New brands of papers have appeared with a variety of textures, to appeal to artists&#x2019; wide-ranging tastes. Versatile illustration board ideally designed and textured for wet media as well as dry is now on the market. Translucent film&#x2013;like vellum, acid-free and of high quality, offers speedy, rich laydown of colors. From fine-toothed silky paper to sandy-textured boards, dazzling pure white or toned to a range of colors, such supports offer an aspiring array of textures, hues, and unique traits&#x2014;the potential unfolds with great possibilities.&nbsp;<br><br> Colored pencil is ever-blossoming as a fine art medium, bringing with it new materials and surfaces, even an expanded concept of what &#x201c;drawing a painting in color&#x201d; means. This book presents many possibilities and techniques for widening those colored pencil boundaries.&nbsp;<br><br> Artists whose work I have admired over the years, whether they were long-recognized figures in colored pencil circles or emerging artists I met through my workshop travels, have been generous in sharing their art, describing their tools and techniques, even revealing their sources of inspiration. You will linger and marvel over their art as I, too, have done. I am most grateful for their participation and the enhancement that their art has lent to <i>The New Colored Pencil</i>. My deepest gratitude goes to these very special guest artists, whose contributions so enhance these pages: Debbie Bowen, Jeannette Buckley, Karen Coleman, Barbara Grant, Mary Hobbs, Laura Miller, Jackie Treat, Ranjini Venkatachari, and Jana Westhusing.<br><br> I hope that learning about colored drawing materials and seeing the work of colored pencil artists will inspire you to consider such techniques and materials and to continue to grow creatively.</p><h2>What to Expect When You&#39;re Expected: A Fetus&#39;s Guide to the First Three Trimesters</h2><p>This new second edition is filled with the latest, most accurate wombhood information, including comforting answers to hundreds of questions, such as<br><br>ï¿½&nbsp;&#x201c;My mother just took a sip of white wine.

Congratulations! Existence is one of the most exciting things that will ever happen to you.<br><br>You are the end result of both four billion years of evolution and three minutes of rubbing. In the cosmic sense, the question of where we come from, along with that of where we<br><br>go when-spoiler alert!-we die, are the unfathomable co-nundrums bookending our brief time on earth. But such metaphysical niceties are, perhaps, too abstract for a lay zygote like yourself. So let's focus on the more immediate causes.<br><i><br>"The Talk"</i><br><br>"Where do babies come from? And when will I get to be one?"<br><br>We'll begin with your mother. Word is she's so dumb, she hears it's chilly outside and gets a bowl. More to the point, she's also fertile, and last month, she released an ovum, or egg, from its dank cell inside the women's prison known as her ovary. No doubt this ovum expected to end up like most or all its older siblings-as part of a small red spot on the white pants Mom foolishly wore to the company picnic. But a different fate was in store for it, a rendezvous with a milky sausagefest known as semen. This liquid comes from your father, and given his track record, the hundreds of millions of sperm comprising it no doubt also expected a grisly end (see chart, p. 5). But last night, inspired by pornography and/or the faded memory of a high-school girlfriend, your father inserted his erect penis, or "pee- pee," into your mother's vagina, or "cooch." They then engaged in a once filthy act now rendered dispiritingly functional. When the semen wrangling was over, five hundred million microscopic demi-Q-tips were discharged intra-coochally. What followed was a brutal ordeal, with contestants forced to swim the equivalent of hundreds of miles upstream with no map and no compass . . . all while literally flagellating themselves. It was exactly like Fear Factor, only it wasn't hosted by Joe Rogan. So at least it was better than Fear Factor.<br><br>The carnage left your mother's birth canal looking like a Civil War battlefield, and as with those battlefields, the scene had probably been reenacted many, many times. But this time was different. This time, one sperm managed to overcome the odds and arrive at his destiny-fair Lady Ovum. Their conversation was the stuff of legend.<br><br>SPERM: 'Tsup.<br><br>EGG: 'Tsup.<br><br>[Awkward pause]<br><br>SPERM: So, I guess we should, ummm . . .<br><br>EGG: Yeah.<br><br>[SPERM begins penetration.]<br><br>SPERM: Does this feel good?<br><br>EGG: Does what feel good?<br><br>SPERM: Yikes.<br><br>The sperm passed through the ovum's outer protective layers-the corona radiata, the zona pellucida, and the moat-until finally reaching its creamy nougat center, where, after one last bumping of uglies, you were created (see Fig. 2).<br><br>Disappointed? Perhaps you'd hoped your entrï¿½e into life would be more "cherubs playing trumpet fanfares" and less "heaping dollops of human ejaculate." This is a common preconception, pre-conception. But in truth, yours was a noble genesis. It turns out nature has a goo fetish. Life itself started with primeval soup.* Ever since, the rule has been: The more complex the species, the ickier its creation. Well, you are earth's highest life-form, and by the time you're born, you'll be covered in so much gunk you'll look like Gollum in chowder!<br><br>A final note: There is a very tiny chance your origin involved neither sperm nor egg, but rather the Word of God breathing flesh into the womb of a Blessed Virgin. If this is the case, man, have we been waiting for You!<br><br>Womb With a View<br><br>"I'm in a petri dish, and a lot of what you've said so far doesn't make sense."<br><br>That's because you're a test-tube baby, and an abomination against the will of God. Unlike regular, or "normal," children, you were created when a doctor removed ova kicking and screaming from their natural habitat and marinated them in sperm that are, in all likelihood, his. (Shhhhhhh!) You'll be waiting in a lab for three to five days, so use this time to soak in the glories of the outside world-the Medi-Sharps collection bin, the overhead fluorescent light, the lab technician.* Eventually, an embryologist will judge you based on evenness of growth, degree of fragmentation, and talent. (Tip: Don't sing "Stayin' Alive." It comes off desperate.) If all goes well, it's just a hop, skip, and a catheter ride back inside Mommy. If not, welcome to the exciting stem-cell research debate!<br><br>Were You an Oopsie?<br><br>"I heard that if the tail on the sperm that conceived me bent to the left it means I was an accident. Is this true or just an old eggs' tale?"<br><br>It is natural to wonder if you were the deliberate creation of two people in love, or the unintended by-product of an office party at Outback Steakhouse gone horribly awry. Alas, none of the widely circulated "methods" of determining intent have any scientific validity, be they the bend of the sperm's tail, the thickness of the zona pellucida, or the notorious infantile taunt,<br><br>If you see the epiblast,<br><br>Mommy has a child at last.<br><br>If the hypoblast is first,<br><br>Daddy's rubber musta burst!<br><br>Nevertheless, in this enlightened age of birth control, single motherhood, and enough Internet porn for mankind to shoot off a cum rope to Neptune every six minutes, it is doubtful you were a total accident. Indeed, it's far more likely you were the extremely unaccidental result of either the test-tube procedure or some other method, such as hormone injections, ovarian stimulation, artificial insemination, frozen-embryo transfers, vaginatherapy, cervical spelunking, testicular taunting, turkey basterectomy, Wiccan acupuncture, gingerroot douches, oyster enemas, sperm bidets, Sybian colonics, intrauterine feng shui, epatoscomancy (divination of the entrails of sacrificed animals), and/or stealing a baby from a hospital.<br><br>Besides, even if your parents didn't mean for you to happen, that has no bearing whatsoever on your intrinsic worth as a human being. It just greatly reduces the chances that you'll get to be one.<br><br>Code Dependency<br><br>"Help! My parents just gave me this 'DNA' stuff, and now it's telling me exactly what to do. Why are they bossing me around?! I'm my own cell!"<br><br>DNA-which stands for "Do Not Alter," the directive it stamps on your soul-is a substance so incredibly potent, it can be used to frame you for murder at the age of eight cells. Chemically, of course, it's a polymerous series of double-helical nucleotides with an ester-bonded sugar/phosphate backbone linking four purine or pyrimidine bases: Awesome Apple(r), Chillin' Cherry(r), Groovylicious Grape(r), and Thrillin' Thymine(r). When a sperm fertilizes an egg, their DNA merge into units called genes. They're an even split, belonging half to your mother and half to your father, just as you will after their prolonged custody battle a few years down the road. These genes are organized into larger units called chromosomes, and this is probably a good time for you to do a self-inventory of those, because you're going to want to have forty-six. Like, exactly. If you're missing a couple, stop what you're doing and find them.* Anyhoo, these chromosomes form your instruction manual, and the new science of genome analysis is now revealing some of the mysteries contained within (see chart, p. 10).<br><br>But though your genes are something over which you have no control, take heart: Your development will be just as profoundly shaped by your upbringing, over which you have merely almost no control. Though the perennial "Nature versus Nurture" debate was resolved 5-4 for Nature by the Supreme Court in 2003, it's now clear the two forces work in conjunction. Nature may preordain that you're a serial killer, but it is nurture that will determine your preferred victim type and method of death. Similarly, the nurture of a warm, loving family will in the end serve only to highlight your true nature as a parasitic slacker living in their basement. So, to address your initial complaint: Don't waste your time in the womb resenting your parents. You have your whole life ahead of you for that.&#x2020;<br><i><br>A Fetal Examination<br>PARENTAL DIAGNOSIS: ALLAYING YOUR FEARS</i><br><br>Eyes, hair color, personality: Fetalcy is a time of uncertainty when it comes to many subjects. Most of these prompt little more than fun debate. But there's one question no embryo likes to joke about, one few even want to discuss: "Are my parents idiots?"<br><br>Until recently, that question could only be answered at birth. But breakthroughs in the field of parental diagnosis mean it's now possible to find out as early as the middle of the first trimester whether your mommy and daddy have any idea what they're doing. Most embryos and fetuses choose not to avail themselves of this option, preferring to cling as long as possible to the faint hope their parents aren't a few bricks shy of a load. But for those in high-risk categories, the benefits of parental diagnosis outweigh the risks. Good candidates include those unborns whose mom or dad<br><br>ï¿½ is over thirty-five and still has a ponytail<br><br>ï¿½ has been exposed, since your conception, to over ten minutes of The Real Housewives of New York City<br><br>ï¿½ is already resented by previous children<br><br>ï¿½ consider themselves well prepared for parenting because "they have two nieces they're so close with"<br><br>ï¿½ has an infant-sized Che Guevara T-shirt all picked out for you<br><br>ï¿½ is a Cubs fan<br><br>Types of Tests<br><br>There are now dozens of tests used to help determine if your parents are neither all that nor a bag of chips. These include analyses of TV habits, iPod playlists, ball-scratching frequency, even voting records.* Among the best known are the following:<br><i><br>Quad Screening</i><br><br>What is it? In quad screening, a technician draws a sample of your parents' blood and tests it for the presence of four substances: Schlitz, patchouli, Chef Boyardee's Dinosaurs with Mini Meatballs, and horse tranquilizer.<br><br>What does it prove? The presence of one of these increases the risk that your parents are incompetent. The presence of all of them indicates that you are the Antichrist.<br><i><br>Vigorous Chronic Sampling (VCS)<br></i><br>What is it? In the presence of a specially trained obstetrician, Mommy and Daddy toke a fat blunt of da chronic, carefully removed from Snoop Dogg's crib.<br><br>What does it prove? If a stranger in a lab coat was able to convince them to smoke some of Snoop Dogg's shit, homeys got shit-ass judgment.<br><i><br>Ultrasuede(r) testing</i><br><br>What is it? Parents are given swatches of Ultrasuede(r)-a remarkable space-age microfiber that feels exactly like suede but is stain- and discoloration-resistant-and asked to rub them with dirt, wine, and tomato sauce. They then clean the stains off with simple soap and water.<br><br>What does it prove? The remarkable durability of Ultrasuede(r)!<br><i><br>Fabiocentesis</i><br><br>What is it? In a very invasive procedure, a team of child-welfare agents raid your mother's bookshelves looking for novels with Fabio on the cover.<br><br>What does it prove? She has too much free time.<br><i><br>Worst-Case Scenario<br></i><br>Parental diagnoses quite frequently reveal that Mommy and Daddy are suffering from severe uncertainty, insecurity, and purposeless gnawing dread. This is a good sign. It shows that they've begun developing the contemporary parenting skills they'll need to replace the love, innate common sense, and three-million-year-old stockpile of genetic wisdom they might otherwise have foolishly relied on. But what if the tests reveal more? What if there is patchouli? What if da chronic does blow their mizz-inds? What if dozens of volumes in Mommy's bookcase are adorned by Fabio's shirtless majesty?<br><br>It's an intensely personal decision. While terminating your parents is a constitutionally protected right (at least for now), it is still a harrowing and frankly somewhat self-destructive proposition. The truth is only .03 percent of parents are absolutely perfect. The remaining 99.97 percent can pretty much be counted on to act like total dumbasses at some or all parts of your life.<br><br>So yes, in all likelihood there is indeed something profoundly wrong with your parents. But is it worth doing something drastic about? Probably not. First off, most kids take great pleasure in discovering how ill equipped Mom and Dad truly are. You may even come to grow fond of them as they cutely flail about, acting like they have the slightest clue about how to raise you. More important, they're not alone.

He heard steady breathing from the still forms of his two companions, and marveled at their ease.<br>He had written in his notebook:<br>* * *<br>The mound is approximately five hundred meters long and half as wide, perhaps a hundred meters high, (apparently) the basaltic cinder cone of a dead volcano, covered with boulder- and cobble-sized chunks of dark black scoria and surrounded by fine white quartz sand. It is not on our maps nor in the 1991 Geosat directory. The flanks of the cone are steeper than the angle of repose, as much as fifty and sixty degrees. The weathering is haphazard at best--some parts open to the sun and rain are jet black, shiny, and other areas are only mildly rusty. There are no insects on the mound--specifically, lift any rock and you will <em>not</em>find a scorpion or millipede. There are no beer cans.<br>* * *<br>Edward, Brad Minelli, and Victor Reslaw had journeyed from Austin, Texas, to combine a little geology with a lot of camping and hiking across the early autumn desert. Edward was the eldest, thirty-three; he was also the shortest and in a close race with Reslaw to lose his hair the fastest. He stood five feet nine inches in his hiking boots, and his slender frame and boyish, inquisitive features made him seem a lot younger, despite the thinning hair. To see objects closer than two feet from his round nose, he wore gold wire-framed round-lensed glasses, a style he had adopted as an adolescent in the late seventies.<br>Edward lay on his back with his hands clasped behind his head and stared up at the clear steady immensity of the sky. Three days before, dark and gravid clouds had conspired in the flaming sunset to drop a true gully-washer into Death Valley. Their camp had been on high ground, but they had seen basketball-sized boulders slide and roll down freshly gouged channels.<br>The desert seemed once again innocent of water and change. All around the camp hung a silence more precious than any amount of gold. Not even the wind spoke.<br>He felt very large in the solitude, as if he might spread his fingers over half the land from horizon to horizon, and gather a mica coat of stars on his fingers. Conversely, in his largeness, he was also a little frightened. This inflated magnitude of self could easily be pricked and shrink to nothing, an illusion of comfort and warmth and high intellectual fever.<br>Not once in his six-year career as a professor of geology had he found a major error in the U.S. Geological Survey Death Valley charts. The Mojave Desert and Death Valley were the Mecca and Al Medina of western U.S. geologists; they had tramped over the regions for well over a century, drawn by the nakedness and shameless variety of the Earth. From its depths miners had hauled borax and talc and gypsum and other useful, unglamorous minerals. In some places, niter-lined caves wedged several hundred feet into the Earth. A spelunker need descend only twenty or thirty feet to feel the heat; creation still lay close under Death Valley.<br>There were hundreds of dead volcanoes, black or sullen red on the tan and gray and pink desert, between the resort at Furnace Creek and the small town of Shoshone, yet each one had been charted and was likely featured in some graduate research paper or another.<br>This mountain was an anomaly.<br>That was impossible.<br>Reslaw and Minelli had shrugged it off as an interesting if unique error on the maps; a misplacement, like the discovery of some new island in an archipelago, known to the natives but lost in a shuffle of navigators&#x2019; charts; a kind of Pitcairn of volcanic mounds.<br>But the cinder cone was too close to routes traveled at least once or twice a year. Edward knew that it had not been misplaced. He could not deceive himself as his friends did.<br>Neither could he posit any other explanation.<br>* * *<br>They walked once again around the base of the mound at midmorning. The sun was already high in the flat, still blue sky. It was going to be a hot day. Red-haired, stocky Reslaw sipped coffee from a green-enameled Thermos bottle, a serviceable antique purchased in a rock-and-junk shop in Shoshone; Edward chewed on a granola bar and sketched details in a small black cloth-bound notebook. Minelli trailed them, idly chipping at boulders with a rock pick, his loose, lanky form, unkempt black hair, and pale skin giving him the appearance of a misplaced urban scrounger.<br>He stopped ten yards behind Edward. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201c; he called out. &#x201c;Did you see this?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A hole.&#x201d;<br>Edward turned back. Reslaw glanced back at them, shrugged, and continued around the mound to the north.<br>The hole was about a meter wide and slanted upward into the mass of the mound. Edward had not seen it because it began in deep shadow, under a ledge illuminated by the warm rays of the sun. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a flow tube. Look how smooth,&#x201c; Minelli said. &#x201c;No collapse, no patterns.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Bad geology,&#x201c; Edward commented. <em>If the mound is a fake, then this is the first mistake</em>.<br>&#x201c;Hm?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not natural. Looks like some prospector got here before us.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why dig a hole in a cinder cone?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s an Indian cave,&#x201c; Edward offered lamely. The hole disturbed him.<br>&#x201c;Indians with diamond drills? Not likely,&#x201c; Minelli said with a faint edge of scorn. Edward ignored his tone and stepped on a lava boulder to get a better look up into the darkness. He pulled a flashlight from his belt and squeezed it to shine a beam into the depths. Smooth-bored matte-finish lava walls absorbed the light beyond eight or ten meters; to that point, the tunnel was straight and featureless, inclining upward at about thirty degrees.<br>&#x201c;Do you smell something?&#x201d; Minelli asked.<br>Edward sniffed. &#x201c;Yeah. What is it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure...&#x201d;<br>The odor was faint and smooth and sweet, slightly acrid. It did not encourage further investigation. &#x201c;Like a lab smell,&#x201c; Minelli said.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it,&#x201c; Edward agreed. &#x201c;Iodine. Crystalline iodine.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;<br>Minelli&#x2019;s forehead wrinkled in a mock fit of manic speculation. &#x201c;Got it,&#x201c; he said. &#x201c;This is a junkie rock. A sanitary junkie cinder cone.&#x201d;<br>Edward ignored him again. Minelli was infamous for a sense of humor so strange it hardly ever produced anything funny. &#x201c;Needle mark,&#x201c; &#x201c;Minelli explained in an undertone, realizing his failure. &#x201c;You still think this isn&#x2019;t a map mistake?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If you found a street in New York City, not on any map, wouldn&#x2019;t you be suspicious?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d call up the mapmakers.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, well, this place is as crowded as New York City, as far as geologists are concerned.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201c; Minelli conceded. &#x201c;So it&#x2019;s <em>new</em>. Just popped up out of nowhere.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That sounds pretty stupid, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Edward said.<br>&#x201c;Your idea, not mine.&#x201d;<br>Edward backed away from the hole and suppressed a shiver. <em>A new mole and it won&#x2019;t go away; a blemish that shouldn&#x2019;t be here</em>.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s Reslaw doing?&#x201d; Minelli asked. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s find him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;This-a-way,&#x201c; Edward said, pointing north. &#x201c;We can still catch up.&#x201d;<br>They heard Reslaw call out.<br>He had not gone far. At the northernmost point of the mound&#x2019;s base, they found him squatting on top of a beetle-shaped lava boulder.<br>&#x201c;Tell me I&#x2019;m not seeing what I&#x2019;m seeing,&#x201c; he said, pointing to the shade below the rock. Minelli made a face and hurried ahead of Edward.<br>In the sand, two meters from the boulder, lay something that at first glance resembled a prehistoric flying creature, a pteranodon perhaps, wings folded, canted over to one side.<br>It was not mineral, Edward decided immediately; it certainly didn&#x2019;t resemble any animal he had seen. That it might be a distorted plant, a peculiar variety of succulent or cactus, seemed the most likely explanation.<br>Minelli edged around the find, cautiously giving it a berth of several yards. Whatever it was, it was about the size of a man, bilaterally symmetric and motionless, dusty gray-green with touches of pastel flesh-pink. Minelli stopped his circling and simply gaped.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s alive,&#x201c; Reslaw said.<br>&#x201c;Did you touch it?&#x201d; Minelli asked.<br>&#x201c;Hell no.&#x201d;<br>Edward kneeled before it. There was a definite logic to the thing; a kind of head two feet long and shaped rather like a bishop&#x2019;s miter, or a flattened artillery, shell, point down in the sand; a knobby pair of shoulder blades behind the fan-crest of the miter; short thin trunk and twisted legs in squat position behind that. Stubby six-digit feet or hands on the ends of the limbs.<br><em>Not a plant</em>.<br>&#x201c;Is it a corpse, maybe?&#x201d; Minelli asked. &#x201c;Wearing something, like a dog, you know, covered with clothes--&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201c; Edward said. He couldn&#x2019;t take his eyes away from the thing. He reached out to touch it, then reconsidered and slowly withdrew his fingers.<br>Reslaw climbed down from the boulder. &#x201c;Scared me so bad I jumped,&#x201c; he explained. <br>&#x201c;Jesus Christ,&#x201c; Minelli said. &#x201c;What do we do?&#x201d;<br>The snout of the miter lifted from the sand and three glassy eyes the color of fine old sherry emerged. The shock was so great that none of the three moved. Edward finally took a step back, almost reluctantly. The eyes in the miter-head followed him, then sank away again, and the head nodded back into the sand. A sound issued from the thing, mu...</p></p><h2>I Have Tampered With the Divine Plan: An Agnes Collection</h2><p>Every once in a great while the glimmer of something different will twinkle from the stack of comic cordwood piled in the daily newspaper.

No source is ignored: Volkogonov even interviewed a member of Stalin&#39;s NKVD hit squad that assassinated Trotsky. Through his access to internal memos sent between Trotsky, Lenin, and Stalin, we learn of the blistering intensity of the animus between Stalin and Trotsky that began under Lenin with petty disputes over military strategy, continued under Stalin with a series of public trials of so-called Trotskyites, and culminated in the extensive planning for and eventual assassination of Trotsky. The result is a stunning work, one that compares the flesh-and-blood Trotsky with the Orator-in-Chief of revolutionary ideology, and discovers contradictions both profound and deadly. Volkogonov unsparingly illustrates Trotsky&#39;s rigidity and ruthlessness, and he takes issue with Trotsky&#39;s military leadership. He shows us that Trotsky&#39;s unwavering, monomaniacal commitment to world communist revolution made him, at times, both corrupt and foolishly myopic. We learn that Trotsky was both the man who gave away his own gold watch to a brave Red Army soldier and the man who advocated the use of blocking units, in which a rear line of soldiers were ordered to shoot their frontline comrades if they failed to charge. Ultimately, as Volkogonov shows, the tragedy of Trotsky is that his internal inconsistencies were a natural part of the entire revolutionary movement, for &#34;Trotsky had declared intellectual war on virtually everyone&#34;. Volkogonov&#39;s account of the &#34;eternal revolutionary&#34; will stand as definitive formany years to come.By Dmitri Volkogonov</p><h2>inZone Book: Any Small Goodness (Reader&#39;s Workshop)</h2><p>Meet &#34;Turo&#34; Rodriquez, who lives with his family in Los Angeles.

In her first novel, popular picture-book author Johnston tells a warm, upbeat story of a Mexican family newly arrived in Los Angeles. The narrator is Arturo Rodriguez, 11, whose present-tense account is filled with Spanish expressions and the physical details of daily life at home, at school, and in the barrio. The first chapter will touch many immigrant kids: the children are tempted to assimilate after their teacher anglicizes their names, but Arturo's <i>abuelita</i> persuades them to hold on to who they are and take their names back. At times Johnston overdoes the local color with too many similes, and some characters are sentimentalized (not that anyone will object to the "angel" librarian). There's a scary gang and a drive-by shooting, but order is restored and the climax is the family celebration of <i>navidad</i>, "warm and sweet and silly, glowing in the candlelight."

Their focus centered on New York City and its vibrant streets&#x2014;a newsboy at work, a brass band on a bustling corner, a crowded beach at Coney Island. Though beautiful, the images harbor strong social commentary on issues of class, child labor, and opportunity. <i>The Radical Camera</i> explores the fascinating blend of aesthetics and social activism at the heart of the Photo League, tracing the group's left-leaning roots and idealism to the worker-photography movement in Europe. Influenced by mentors Lewis Hine, Berenice Abbott, and Paul Strand, artists in the Photo League worked within a unique complex comprising a school, a darkroom, a gallery, and a salon, in which photography was discussed as both a means for social change and an art form. The influence of the Photo League artists on modern photography was enormous, ushering in the New York School.&nbsp;</p><p>Presenting 150 works of the members of the Photo League alongside complementary essays that offer new interpretations of the League's work, ideas, and pedagogy, this beautifully illustrated book features artists including Margaret Bourke-White, Sid Grossman, Morris Engel, Lisette Model, Ruth Orkin, Walter Rosenblum, Aaron Siskind, W.

That policy was dramatically confronted in the late 1960s when a loose coalition of hippies, civil rights advocates, Black Panthers, unions, Mexican-Americans, Quakers and other Christians, celebrities, and others joined with Red Power activists to fight for Indian rights. <br><br>In <em>Hippies, Indians and the Fight for Red Power</em>, Sherry Smith offers the first full account of this remarkable story. Hippies were among the first non-Indians of the post-World War II generation to seek contact with Native Americans. The counterculture saw Indians as genuine holdouts against conformity, inherently spiritual, ecological, tribal, communal-the original "long hairs." Searching for authenticity while trying to achieve social and political justice for minorities, progressives of various stripes and colors were soon drawn to the Indian cause. Black Panthers took part in Pacific Northwest fish-ins. Corky Gonzales' Mexican American Crusade for Justice provided supplies and support for the Wounded Knee occupation. Actor Marlon Brando and comedian Dick Gregory spoke about the problems Native Americans faced. For their part, Indians understood they could not achieve political change without help. Non-Indians had to be educated and enlisted. Smith shows how Indians found, among this hodge-podge of dissatisfied Americans, willing recruits to their campaign for recognition of treaty rights; realization of tribal power, sovereignty, and self-determination; and protection of reservations as cultural homelands. The coalition was ephemeral but significant, leading to political reforms that strengthened Indian sovereignty.<br><br>Thoroughly researched and vividly written, this book not only illuminates this transformative historical moment but contributes greatly to our understanding of social movements.<br></p><p><br><strong>Sherry L. Smith</strong> is University Distinguished Professor of History and Associate Director of the Clements Center for Southwest Studies at Southern Methodist University.

Smith brings to light a series of cross-cultural encounters during the Red Power era that until now have not been carefully parsed...Her persuasive analysis reveals example after example of meaningful cooperation and sincere mutual support...It is a bold and important retelling that should shape our discussions for years to come."--<em>Western Historical Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"Smith's book is...a model of cross-racial negotiation. She sees her task as correcting the record on the makeup of Red Power politics without diminishing the leadership of 'the original American 'long hairs' or the costs borne by their communities. She...judiciously trac[es] the false starts and the achievements of co-operation."--Christine Bold, <em>Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br>"Smith must be commended for opening a new door on the counterculture-Indian relationship. Smith's well written text substantially advances our understanding of the multiethnic nature of Native American activism in the 1960s and 1970s, and it both reveals and redeems the imaginings of Indianness by sixties hippies as important to that cause."--<em>Current Anthropology</em> <br><p></p><br>"Elegantly written and thoroughly documented Smith does an excellent job of shedding light not only on the complicated relations between Indians and non-Indians but also on the nuances within Indian America, particularly among various Red Power movements, more established organizations like the National Congress of American Indians, and reservation-based tribal governments."--Akim D. Reinhardt, <em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"An outstanding book...Smith has written one of the very best histories of 'Red Power'...Her account of how Indian activists fought for greater sovereignty and control over their lands and their collective lives by attracting outside support and forging alliances with nonIndians is a moving and thought-provoking tale...Her method in analyzing the Red Power movement is innovative...An exemplary account of a major sixties-era social change movement that can serve as a conceptual model."--<em>H-Net Reviews</em><p></p><br>"A convincing, concise, and readable introduction to a topic with which many readers may be unfamiliar."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"If ever there was a story difficult to get right, it's the turbulent confluence of hippies and American Indians in the 1960s and 70s. Sherry Smith gets it right."--Stewart Brand, author of <em>Whole Earth Discipline</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"With penetrating analysis, Sherry Smith argues eloquently that the 1960s and 1970s were the defining moment in modern political history for America and American Indians struggling for justice. This book defines this pivotal time; it contextualizes nationwide political activism by putting an odd couple--Indians and hippies together--on the center stage of making history. Absolutely brilliant!"--Donald L. Fixico, author of <em>The Urban Indian Experience in America</em><p></p><br>"Sherry Smith has done a masterful job of sorting out the braided cultural strains which tangled and interpenetrated during the cultural and political revolutions of the Sixties. I was present at a number of these events, knew many of the players, and am amazed at the way she has clarified 'the fog of war,' which is how history recounted appears to participants. Her book covers an unacknowledged aspect of Native people's struggle for justice and the confusing, often ignorant manner in which counter-culture hipsters, liberals, and well-meaning do-gooders tried to 'help' them. Through it all, 'White' cultural assumptions loom as large as a rude and noisy guest at a prayer breakfast. It's eye-opening, ground-breaking work and deserves to be read."--Peter Coyote, actor and author of <em>Sleeping Where I Fall</em><p></p><br>"Without ever losing sight of the larger tragedy of American Indian history, Sherry Smith writes deftly and often wryly of the 1960s and 1970s when the counterculture and the New Left discovered Indians, and Indians discovered the political possibilities that alienated young white Americans presented. The results were sometimes comic, sometimes painful, occasionally touching, but always revealing of the changing valence of Indian peoples and cultures in American society and American politics. This is an original and absorbing book."--Richard White, Stanford University<p></p><br>"In <em>Hippies, Indians, and the Fight for Red Power</em>, author Sherry L. Smith deftly uses this phrase, and the era of countercultural rebellion it reflected, to frame a well-researched, balanced, and engaging exploration of the intercultural collaborations between Natives and non-Natives in the Red Power Movement."--<em>American Studies</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Ed Emberley</h2><p>Ed Emberley shies away from calling himself an artist and instead likes to say that &#x201c;he draws pictures for a living.&#x201d; Now in his eighties, Ed Emberley is a Caldecott award-winning children&#x2019;s book illustrator and writer who has been creating original books since the 1960s.

Haught suggests that what is lacking in both of these competing ideologies is the notion of novelty, a necessary component of evolution and the essence of the unfolding of divine Mystery. He argues that Darwin's disturbing picture of life, instead of being hostile to religion - as scientific skeptics and many believers have thought it to be - actually provides a most fertile setting for mature reflection on the idea of God. Solidly grounded in scholarship, Haught's explanation of the relationship between theology and evolution is both accessible and engaging.</p><p><b>John F.

Wilkens acquaints students with the vast array of classic and contemporary approaches to ethics: cultural relativism, emotivism, behaviourism, hedonism, ethical egoism, atheistic existentialism, utilitarianism, categorical imperative, hierarchicalism, situation ethics, theistic existentialism, theological voluntarism, and natural law ethics. For each system, his thorough introduction explores its popular &#34;bumper sticker&#34; expression, its core assumptions and basic elements, the questions that give rise to it, and its strengths and weaknesses. Students, professors and general readers will welcome Wilken&#39;s engaging text which simultaneously offers a well-rounded assessment of ethical systems and shows the relevance and prevalence of ethical ideas in daily life.</p><p></p><h2>An Empire Divided: Religion, Republicanism, and the Making of French Colonialism, 1880-1914</h2><p>Between 1880 and 1914, tens of thousands of men and women left France for distant religious missions, driven by the desire to spread the word of Jesus Christ, combat Satan, and convert the world's pagans to Catholicism. But they were not the only ones with eyes fixed on foreign shores. Just as the Catholic missionary movement reached its apex, the young, staunchly secular Third Republic launched the most aggressive campaign of colonial expansion in French history. Missionaries and republicans abroad knew they had much to gain from working together, but their starkly different motivations regularly led them to view one another with resentment, distrust, and even fear. <br> <br> In <em>An Empire Divided</em>, J.P. Daughton tells the story of how troubled relations between Catholic missionaries and a host of republican critics shaped colonial policies, Catholic perspectives, and domestic French politics in the tumultuous decades before the First World War. With case studies on Indochina, Polynesia, and Madagascar, <em>An Empire Divided</em>--the first book to examine the role of religious missionaries in shaping French colonialism--challenges the long-held view that French colonizing and "civilizing" goals were shaped by a distinctly secular republican ideology built on Enlightenment ideals. By exploring the experiences of Catholic missionaries, one of the largest groups of French men and women working abroad, Daughton argues that colonial policies were regularly wrought in the fires of religious discord--discord that indigenous communities exploited in responding to colonial rule. <br> <br> After decades of conflict, Catholics and republicans in the empire ultimately buried many of their disagreements by embracing a notion of French civilization that awkwardly melded both Catholic and republican ideals. But their entente came at a price, with both sides compromising long-held and much-cherished traditions for the benefit of establishing and maintaining authority. Focusing on the much-neglected intersection of politics, religion, and imperialism, Daughton offers a new understanding of both the nature of French culture and politics at the fin de siecle, as well as the power of the colonial experience to reshape European's most profound beliefs.<br></p><p>J.P. Daughton is Assistant Professor of History at Stanford University.<br>"Through his concentration on the interactoin of French Catholic (sometimes Protestant) missionaries and colonial official in indochina, Tahiti and the Marquesas, and Madagascar during the formative period of France's overseas empire and its colonial ideology, Daughton provides an important contribution to the extant literature on colonialism, modern France, and modern religious history...Daughton furnishes an important contribution to our understanding of the formative years of France's colonial empire in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries...A much-needed corrective to the extant scholarship on France's notion of the <em>mission civilisatrice</em>."--James E.

It presents theories on aging, the aging process, the structural and functional changes that characterize advancing age, exercise programming concerns for the aged, drug use and abuse by seniors, and the benefits of exercise and physical activity. </p><p>This text offers a more expansive discussion of the particulars of exercise physiology of aging persons than is found in other texts on the subject. With <i>Physiology of Exercise and Healthy Aging</i>, readers will gain a thorough understanding of the role of physical activity on the aging process, the principles of exercise and assessment considerations for elderly adults, and training for special needs of older adults. Information is presented in the context of three groups found in the aging and health spectrum: average aging individuals, frail elderly, and master athletes. This information is organized within a three-part structure: </p><p>-<b>Part I</b> explores age-related changes in the major physiological systems. The effects of physical activity on these systems, as well as necessary adaptations for those with impaired abilities in each system, are also discussed. </p><p>-<b>Part II</b> deals with the interactive roles of nutrition; age-related diseases, such as diabetes and osteoporosis; and physical activity. </p><p>-<b>Part III</b> presents the physiologic adaptability that may be expected with training and physical activity of older adults. It also addresses the practical issues that must be considered when working with this population, including training for aerobic, anerobic, and muscular fitness; exercise adherence and safety measures; and potential substance abuse of commonly used medications.<br>In addition to the presentation of foundational concepts of physiology as they relate to the process of aging, chapters of<i> Physiology of Exercise and Healthy Aging</i> contain exercise regimens related to the chapter topic, other forms of physical activity that have proven beneficial to the aging population, and contraindicated exercises. Physiological responses to acute and chronic exercise perturbations are examined, including studies of cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle metabolism and strength, neurophysiology and the senses, and the effects of exercise on older adults with the diseases of aging, including type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, arthritis, and cardiovascular disease. Chapter-opening quotes provide the insights of selected thinkers, scientists, and fitness professionals on the topic discussed.</p><p>Practitioners who work with older adults will find programming recommendations in each chapter to help translate the science into practice. An appendix offers easy access to forms and assessments, including a Three-Day Nutritional Assessment form and a Client History form. The language used throughout the text embraces the science of exercise physiology but also welcomes practitioners to apply the information presented.</p><p>For student readers, <i>Physiology of Exercise and Healthy Aging</i> incorporates these helpful features to assist learning and retention: </p><p>-Chapter-opening outlines offer quick reference to topics. </p><p>-Chapter-ending Questions to Consider provide tools for self-study and reflection. </p><p>-Numerous tables and figures reinforce chapter concepts and add visual or statistical information related to the process of aging, fall prevention, international demographics, and theories of aging.</p><p>-References provide additional opportunities for reading and research with selected books, articles, and Web sites. </p><p>-Appendixes contain information on specific Web sites and numerous tests and forms that may be photocopied for use with clients or patients or for course projects.<br><i>Physiology of Exercise and Healthy Aging </i>contains a thorough discussion of the unique effects of aging on the human body and illustrates the power of exercise as a preventive tool to reduce or offset the deleterious effects of aging in order to increase the quality of life enjoyed by our aging population. With this text, both students and professionals will grasp the advantages of appropriate physical activity for the elderly and how to safely administer exercise programs that contribute to the increased health and quality of life for older adults.</p><p></p></p><p><p><b>Albert W.

Does the future exist? Is time travel possible? If so, does it threaten the work prospects of historians, as Stephen Hawking thinks? Why does time seem to pass in only one direction?

In this fascinating and revealing study, Thomas Frank shows how the youthful revolutionaries were joined&#x2014;and even anticipated &#x2014;by such unlikely allies as the advertising industry and the men's clothing business.<br><br>"[Thomas Frank is] perhaps the most provocative young cultural critic of the moment."&#x2014;Gerald Marzorati, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"An indispensable survival guide for any modern consumer."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review<br><br>"Frank makes an ironclad case not only that the advertising industry cunningly turned the countercultural rhetoric of revolution into a rallying cry to buy more stuff, but that the process itself actually predated any actual counterculture to exploit."&#x2014;Geoff Pevere, <i>Toronto Globe and Mail</i><br><br>"<i>The Conquest of Cool</i> helps us understand why, throughout the last third of the twentieth century, Americans have increasingly confused gentility with conformity, irony with protest, and an extended middle finger with a populist manifesto. . . . His voice is an exciting addition to the soporific public discourse of the late twentieth century."&#x2014;T. J. Jackson Lears, <i>In These Times</i><br><br>"An invaluable argument for anyone who has ever scoffed at hand-me-down counterculture from the '60s. A spirited and exhaustive analysis of the era's advertising."&#x2014;Brad Wieners, <i>Wired Magazine</i><br><br>"Tom Frank is . . . not only old-fashioned, he's anti-fashion, with a place in his heart for that ultimate social faux pas, leftist politics."&#x2014;Roger Trilling, <i>Details</i><br></p><p>In his book-length essay <i>The Conquest of Cool</i>, Thomas Frank explores the ways in which Madison Avenue co-opted the language of youthful '60s rebellion. It is "the story," Frank writes, "of the bohemian cultural style's trajectory from adversarial to hegemonic; the story of hip's mutation from native language of the alienated to that of advertising." This appropriation had wide-ranging consequences that deeply transformed our culture--consequences that linger in the form of '90s "hip consumerism." (Think of Nike using the song "Revolution" to sell sneakers, or Coca-Cola using replicas of Ken Kesey's bus to peddle Fruitopia.) <p> This is no simplistic analysis of how the counterculture "sold out" to big business. Instead, Frank shows how the counterculture and business culture influenced one another. In fact, he writes, the counterculture's critique of mass society mimicked earlier developments in business itself, when a new generation of executives attacked the stultified, hierarchical nature of corporate life. Counterculture and business culture evolved together over time--until the present day, when they have become essentially the same thing. According to Frank, the '60s live on in the near-archetypal dichotomy of "hip" and "square," now part of advertising vernacular, signifying a choice between consumer styles.</p>While the youth counterculture remains the most evocative and best-remembered symbol of the cultural ferment of the 1960s, the revolution that shook American business during those boom years has gone largely unremarked. In this fascinating and revealing new study, Thomas Frank shows how the youthful revolutionaries were joined - and even anticipated by - such unlikely allies as the advertising industry and the men&#39;s clothing business. In both areas, each having also been an important pillar of fifties conservatism, the utopian, complacent surface of postwar consumerism was smashed by a new breed of admen and manufacturers who openly addressed public distrust of their industries, who recognized the absurdity of consumer society, who made war on conformity, and who finally settled on youth rebellion and counterculture as the symbol of choice for their new marketing vision. The Conquest of Cool is a thorough history of advertising as well as an incisive commentary on the evolution of a peculiarly American sensibility, the pervasive co-optation that defines today&#39;s hip commercial culture. By studying the devices and institutions of co-optation rather than those of resistance, Frank offers a picture of the 1960s that differs dramatically from the accounts of youth rebellion and sell-out that have become so familiar over the years. The Conquest of Cool forsakes the stories of campus and bohemia to follow the Dodge Rebellion, chronicle the Pepsi Generation, and recount the Peacock Revolution - by so doing, it raises important new questions about the culture of that most celebrated and maligned decade.</p><h2>Land Development Handbook</h2><p>A comprehensive reference on the land development design process, for professionals including engineers, planners, surveyors, architects, attorneys, and developers.

From this perspective the crisis was an interruption, caused by bad policy or bad people, and full recovery is to be expected if the cause is corrected.<br> <br><i>The End of Normal </i>challenges this view. Placing the crisis in perspective, Galbraith argues that the 1970s already ended the age of easy growth. The 1980s and 1990s saw only uneven growth, with rising inequality within and between countries. And the 2000s saw the end even of that&#x2014;despite frantic efforts to keep growth going with tax cuts, war spending, and financial deregulation. When the crisis finally came, stimulus and automatic stabilization were able to place a floor under economic collapse. But they are not able to bring about a return to high growth and full employment.<br> <br>Today, four factors impede a return to normal. They are the rising costs of real resources, the now-evident futility of military power, the labor-saving consequences of the digital revolution, and the breakdown of law and ethics in the financial sector. The Great Crisis should be seen as a turning point, a barometer of the rise of unstable economic conditions, which should be regarded as the new normal. Policies and institutions going forward should be designed, above all, <i>modestly, </i>to cope with this fact, maintaining conditions for a good life in difficult times.</p><p>James K. Galbraith holds the Lloyd M. Bentsen Jr. Chair in Government/Business Relations at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin. He lives in Austin, Texas. <i>The End of Normal</i> is his first book.The End of Normal One<p></p> Growth Now and Forever<p></p> <br>To begin to understand why the Great Financial Crisis broke over an astonished world, one needs to venture into the mentality of the guardians of expectation&#x2014;the leadership of the academic economics profession&#x2014;in the years before the crisis. Most of today&#x2019;s leading economists received their formation from the late 1960s through the 1980s. But theirs is a mentality that goes back further: to the dawn of the postwar era and the Cold War in the United States, largely as seen from the cockpits of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Chicago, Illinois. It was then, and from there, that the modern and still-dominant doctrines of American economics emerged.<br> <br>To put it most briefly, these doctrines introduced the concept of economic growth and succeeded, over several decades, to condition most Americans to the belief that growth was not only desirable but also normal, perpetual, and expected. Growth became the solution to most (if not quite all) of the ordinary economic problems, especially poverty and unemployment. We lived in a culture of growth; to question it was, well, countercultural. The role of government was to facilitate and promote growth, and perhaps to moderate the cycles that might, from time to time, be superimposed over the underlying trend. A failure of growth became unimaginable. Occasional downturns would occur&#x2014;they would now be called recessions&#x2014;but recessions would be followed by recovery and an eventual return to the long-term trend. That trend was defined as the potential output, the long-term trend at high employment, which thus became the standard.<br> <br>To see what was new about this, it&#x2019;s useful to distinguish this period both from the nineteenth-century Victorian mentality described by Karl Marx in Capital or John Maynard Keynes in The Economic Consequences of the Peace, and from the common experience in the first half of the twentieth century.<br> <br>To the Victorians, the ultimate goal of society was not economic growth as we understand it. It was, rather, investment or capital accumulation. Marx put it in a phrase: &#x201c;Accumulate, accumulate! That is Moses and the Prophets!&#x201d; Keynes wrote: &#x201c;Europe was so organized socially and economically as to secure the maximum accumulation of capital&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Here, in fact, lay the main justification of the capitalist system. If the rich had spent their new wealth on their own enjoyments, the world would have long ago found such a rï¿½gime intolerable. But like bees they saved and accumulated&#x201d; (Keynes 1920, 11).<br> <br>But accumulate for what? In principle, accumulation was for profits and for power, even for survival. It was what capitalists felt obliged to do by their economic and social positions. The purpose of accumulation was not to serve the larger interest of the national community. It was not to secure a general improvement in living standards. The economists of the nineteenth century did not hold out great hopes for the progress of living standards. The Malthusian trap (population outrunning resources) and the iron law of wages were dominant themes. These held that in the nature of things, wages could not exceed subsistence for very long. And even as resources became increasingly abundant, the Marxian dynamic&#x2014;the extraction of surplus value by the owners of capital&#x2014;reinforced the message that workers should expect no sustained gains. Competition between capitalists, including the introduction of machinery, would keep the demand for labor and the value of wages down. Marx again:<br> <br>&#x201c;Like every other increase in the productiveness of labour, machinery is intended to cheapen commodities, and, by shortening that portion of the working-day, in which the labourer works for himself, to lengthen the other portion that he gives, without an equivalent, to the capitalist. In short, it is a means for producing surplus-value.&#x201d; (Marx 1974, vol. 1, ch. 15, 351)<br> <br>Yet living standards did improve. That they did so&#x2014;however slowly, as Keynes later noted&#x2014;was a mystery for economists at the time. The improvement might be attributed to the growth of empires and the opening of new territories to agriculture and mining, hence the importance of colonies in that era. But in the nineteenth century, economics taught that such gains could only be transitory. Fairly soon population growth and the pressure of capitalist competition on wages would drive wages down again. Even a prosperous society would ultimately have low wages, and its working people would be poor. This grim fatalism, at odds though it was with the facts in Europe and America, was the reason that economics was known as the &#x201c;dismal science.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then came the two great wars of the twentieth century, along with the Russian Revolution and the Great Depression. Human and technical capabilities surged, and (thanks to the arrival of the age of oil) resource constraints fell away. But while these transformations were under way, and apart from the brief boom of the 1920s, material conditions of civilian life in most of the industrial countries declined, or were stagnant, or were constrained by the exigencies of wartime. The Great Depression, starting in the mid-1920s in the United Kingdom and after 1929 in the United States, appeared to signal the collapse of the Victorian accumulation regime&#x2014;and with it, the end of the uneasy truce and symbiotic relationship between labor and capital that had graced the prewar years. Now the system itself was in peril.<br> <br>For many, the question then became: could the state do the necessary accumulation instead? This was the challenge of communism, which in a parallel universe not far away showed its military power alongside its capacity to inspire the poor and to accelerate industrial development. In some noncommunist countries, democratic institutions became stronger&#x2014;as they tend to do when governments need soldiers&#x2014;giving voice to the economic aspirations of the whole population. For social democrats and socialists, planning was the new alternative&#x2014;a prospect that horrified Friedrich von Hayek, who argued in 1944 that planning and totalitarianism were the same.<br> <br>By the 1950s, communism ruled almost half the world. In the non-communist part, it could no longer be a question of building things up for a distant, better future. Entire populations felt entitled to a share of the prosperity that was at hand&#x2014;for instance, to college educations, to automobiles, and to homes. To deny them would have been dangerous. Yet the future also could not be neglected, and (especially given the communist threat) no one in the &#x201c;free world&#x201d; thought that the need for new investments and still greater technological progress was over. Therefore it was a matter of consuming and investing in tandem, so as to have both increased personal consumption now and the capacity for still greater consumption later on. This was the new intellectual challenge, and the charm, and the usefulness to Cold Warriors, of the theory of economic growth.<br> The Golden Years<p></p> <br>From 1945 to 1970, the United States enjoyed a growing and generally stable economy and also dominance in world affairs. Forty years later, this period seems brief and distant, but at the time it seemed to Americans the natural culmination of national success. It was the start of a new history, justified by victory in war and sustained in resistance to communism. That there was a communist challenge imparted both a certain no-nonsense pragmatism to policy, empowering the Cold War liberals of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the RAND Corporation, while driving the free-market romantics of Chicago (notably Milton Friedman) to the sidelines. Yet few seriously doubted that challenge could or should be met. The United States was the strongest country, the most advanced, the undamaged victor in world war, the leader of world manufacturing, the home of the great industrial corporation, and the linchpin of a new, permanent, stable architecture of international finance. These were facts, not simply talking points, and it took a brave and even self-marginalizing economist, willing to risk professional isolation in the mold of Paul Baran and Paul Sweezy, to deny them.<br> <br>Nor were optimism and self-confidence the preserve of elites. Ordinary citizens agreed, and to keep them in fear of communism under the circumstances required major investments in propaganda. Energy was cheap. Food was cheap, with (thanks to price supports) staples such as milk and corn and wheat in great oversupply. Interest rates were low and credit was available to those who qualified, and so housing, though modest by later standards, was cheap enough for whites. Jobs were often unionized, and their wages rose with average productivity gains. Good jobs were not widely open to women, but the men who held them had enough, by the standards of the time, for family life. As wages rose, so did taxes, and the country could and did invest in long-distance roads and suburbs. There were big advances in childhood health, notably against polio but also measles, mumps, rubella, tuberculosis, vitamin deficiencies, bad teeth, and much else besides. In many states, higher education was tuition-free in public universities with good reputations. Though working-class white America was much poorer than today and much more likely to die poor, there had never been a better time to have children. And there never would be again. Over the eighteen years of the baby boom, from 1946 to 1964, the fruits of growth were matched by a rapidly rising population to enjoy them.<br> <br>It was in this spirit that, in the 1950s, economists invented the theory of economic growth. The theory set out to explain why things were good and how the trajectory might be maintained. Few economists in the depression-ridden and desperate 1930s would have considered wasting time on such questions, but now they seemed critical: What did growth depend on? What were the conditions required for growth to be sustained? How much investment could you have without choking off consumption and demand? How much consumption could you have without starving the future? The economists&#x2019; answer would be that, in the long run, economic growth depended on three factors: population growth, technological change, and saving.<br> <br>It was not a very deep analysis, and its principal authors did not claim that it was. In the version offered by Robert Solow, the rate of population growth was simply assumed. It would be whatever it happened to be&#x2014;rising as death rates came under control, and then falling again, later on, as fertility rates also declined, thanks to urban living and birth control. Thomas Robert Malthus, the English parson who in 1798 had written that population would always rise, so as to force wages back down to subsistence, was now forgotten. How could his theory possibly be relevant in so rich a world?<br> <br>Technology was represented as the pure product of science and invention, available more or less freely to all as it emerged. This second great simplification enabled economists to duck the question of where new machinery and techniques came from. In real life, of course, new products and processes bubbled up from places like Los Alamos and Bell Labs and were mostly built into production via capital investment and protected by patents and secrecy. Big government gave us the atom bomb and the nuclear power plant; big business gave us the transistor. Working together, the two gave us jets, integrated circuits, and other wonders, but the textbooks celebrated James Watt and Thomas Edison and other boy geniuses and garage tinkerers, just as they would continue to do in the age of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, whose products would be just as much the offshoots of the work of government and corporate labs.<br> <br>With both population and technology flowing from the outside, the growth models were designed to solve for just one variable, and that was the rate of saving (and investment). If saving could be done at the right rate, the broad lesson of the growth model was that good times could go on. There was what the model called a &#x201c;steady-state expansion path,&#x201d; and the trick to staying on it was to match personal savings with the stock of capital, the growth of the workforce, and the pace of progress. Too much saving, and an economy would slip back into overcapacity and unemployment. Too little, and capital&#x2014;and therefore growth&#x2014;would dry up. But with just the right amount, the economy could grow steadily and indefinitely, with a stable internal distribution of income. The task for policy, therefore, was only to induce the right amount of saving. This was not a simple calculation: economists made their reputations working out what the right value (the &#x201c;golden rule&#x201d;) for the saving rate should be. But the problem was not impossibly complex either, and it was only dimly realized (if at all) that its seeming manageability was made possible by assuming away certain difficulties.<br> <br>The idea that unlimited growth and improvement were possible, with each generation destined to live better than the one before, was well suited to a successful and optimistic people. It was also what their leaders wanted them to believe; indeed, it was a sustaining premise of the postwar American vision. Moreover, there was an idea that this growth did not come necessarily at the expense of others; it was the product of the right sort of behavior and not of privilege and power. Tracts such as Walt W. Rostow&#x2019;s Stages of Economic Growth spread the message worldwide: everyone could eventually go through &#x201c;take-off &#x201d; and reach the plateau of high mass consumption.I Capitalism, suitably tamed by social democracy and the welfare state, could deliver everything communism promised, and more. And it could do it without commissars or labor camps.<br> <br>A curiosity of the models was the many things they left out. The &#x201c;factors of production&#x201d; were &#x201c;labor&#x201d; and &#x201c;capital.&#x201d; Labor was just a measure of time worked, limited only by the size of the labor force and expected to grow exponentially with the human population. Capital (a controversial construct, subject to intense debate in the 1950s) was to be thought of as machinery, made from labor, measured essentially as the amalgam of the past human effort required to build the machines. As every textbook would put it, if Y is output, K is capital, and L is labor, then:<br> <br>Y = f(K, L)<br> <br>This simple equation said only that output was a function of two inputs: capital and labor. Note that, in this equation, resources and resource costs did not appear.II<br> <br>The notion of production, therefore, was one of immaculate conception: an interaction of machinery with human hands but operating on nothing. Economists (Milton Friedman, notably) sometimes expressed this model as one in which the only goods produced were, actually, services&#x2014;an economy of barbershops and massage parlors, so to speak. How this fiction passed from hand to hand without embarrassment seems, in deep retrospect, a mystery. The fact that in the physical world, one cannot actually produce anything without resources passed substantially unremarked, or covered by the assumption that resources are drawn freely from the environment and then disposed of equally freely when no longer needed. Resources were quite cheap and readily available&#x2014;and as the theory emerged, the problem of pollution only came slowly into focus.

I had heard about the rough relationship between August Busch III and his son, August Busch IV, but the rumors hadn&#x2019;t prepared me for the reality of the situation on the ground in St. Louis. They had a huge blowup over whether to buy a top-of-the-line private jet not long after August IV became CEO, when they should have been figuring out how to save Budweiser. The company&#x2019;s board of directors got stuck trying to mediate their arguments, and I doubt that had been in their job descriptions. I was also surprised at how close Anheuser-Busch came to merging with Modelo to try to save itself, and at how that all ultimately fell apart. I had covered this deal as a journalist and had known the whole time that the two companies were talking, but I hadn&#x2019;t known they were just inches from the finish line. </p> <p> <i> Did you run into any hurdles as you worked to uncover everything that happened behind the scenes?</i><br> I wasn&#x2019;t worried about getting access to key people on Wall Street who were involved in the takeover. I&#x2019;d known many of them for years. But I was nervous about the reception I&#x2019;d get from insiders at Anheuser-Busch. I figured the relationship between August III and August IV would be the toughest thing to explore because people had been so closed-mouthed about it in the past, but that was one of the angles my sources were the most eager to talk about. Those two guys are fascinating characters, and I think the people who had witnessed some of their more outrageous moments felt they deserved to be brought to light as part of the story. I got the sense, in general, that this book was a chance for catharsis for some people. The way it all went down is just too fascinating to sweep under the rug with the rest of the mess from the economic crash. </p> <p> <i>Is this the story of The Busch family dynasty imploding? If so, in what way?</i><br> It depends on how you look at it. Adolphus Busch might roll over in his grave if he knew Budweiser was being brewed by Brazilians. But the Busch family hadn&#x2019;t actually controlled Anheuser-Busch for years &#x2013; many people just thought they still did. Some family members made hundreds of millions of dollars on this deal. They&#x2019;re so rich now that it&#x2019;s almost incomprehensible. That&#x2019;s not a bad consolation prize.</p> <p> <i> Was the takeover inevitable? And what are the implications now that such a beloved American icon is being run by a foreign company? </i><br> If Anheuser-Busch hadn&#x2019;t arrogantly ignored what was going on in the rest of the world, it wouldn&#x2019;t have been inevitable. But the company focused far too heavily on America, as if this is the only place where people drink beer. Now, thousands of workers have lost their jobs, beer prices are higher, and you have a bunch of Brazilians running around in Missouri. The company has even started charging for Clydesdale appearances. That Bud Light you drank last weekend was brewed by a Brazilian number-cruncher. The big question is whether that actually matters in a globalized world.</p></p><p><p>Once upon a time, the "King of Beers" ruled the world&#x2014;Budweiser controlled 52 percent of the U.S. beer market, and Anheuser-Busch was the world's top brewer. Then, economic hardship fell upon the land of milk and honey (and baseball, apple pie, and Chevrolet), and the King became a pawn that easily fell into the hands of foreign interests. Today, the Great American Lager is no more. Anheuser-Busch's fairy tale is over, and as Dethroning the King: The Hostile Takeover of Anheuser-Busch, an American Icon details, the legendary company collapsed in spectacular fashion. How it all played out behind the scenes is the real story&#x2013;and it's one people should get used to hearing as foreign companies set their sights on America's most popular brands, taking advantage of a weakened American economy and preying on American corporations that have for far too long viewed themselves as "too big to be taken over."</p> <p>In the summer of 2008&#x2014;investment bank Bear Stearns had already collapsed; lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were teetering on the verge of insolvency; financial services firm Lehman Brothers would soon declare the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history; and Anheuser-Busch had just received a takeover bid from foreign brewing giant InBev. As Dethroning the King describes, InBev's timing wasn't just lucky; it was perfect.</p> <p>Anheuser-Busch, which had been ruled for decades by iron-fisted scion August A. Busch III, had just handed the reins to his son, August A. Busch IV&#x2014;and young August's leadership was drawing lukewarm reviews from investors and even his own board of directors. Americans all across the country, meanwhile, were too distracted by their imploding personal finances to be concerned about Anheuser-Busch's fate. Many Americans had never even heard of global brewing behemoth InBev, and they didn't realize Budweiser had come under foreign attack until it was too late.</p> <p>On November 18, 2008, the stock of Anheuser-Busch, known for its "BUD" ticker symbol, stopped trading, and one of America's oldest, most beloved brands lost its American-owned status. In Dethroning the King, Julie MacIntosh&#x2014;the U.S. Mergers and Acquisitions Correspondent who led the Financial Times's coverage of the takeover of Anheuser-Busch&#x2014;takes you behind the scenes to tell the inside story of the King of Beers' 150-year rise to power and its seven-week fall from grace.</p><b>Praise for DETHRONING THE KING</b> <p>"Julie MacIntosh has given us not just an anatomy of a deal, but an anatomy of a company, a community, and a family.

Barely educated and valued since childhood strictly for his labor, Ernaux's father had grown into a hard, practical man who showed his family little affection. Narrating his slow ascent towards material comfort, Ernaux's cold observation reveals the shame that haunted her father throughout his life. She scrutinizes the importance he attributed to manners and language that came so unnaturally to him as he struggled to provide for his family with a grocery store and cafe in rural France. Over the course of the book, Ernaux grows up to become the uncompromising observer now familiar to the world, while her father matures into old age with a staid appreciation for life as it is and for a daughter he cautiously, even reluctantly admires. <i>A Man's Place</i> is the companion book to her critically acclaimed memoir about her mother,<i> A Woman's Story</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in 1940, ANNIE ERNAUX grew up in Normandy, studied at Rouen University, and began teaching high school.

McGann presents a new, <i>critical</i> view of the subject that calls for a radically revisionary reading of Romanticism.<br> <br> In the course of his study, McGann analyzes both the predominant theories of Romanticism (those deriving from Coleridge, Hegel, and Heine) and the products of its major English practitioners. Words worth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Byron are considered in greatest depth, but the entire movement is subjected to a searching critique. Arguing that poetry is produced and reproduced within concrete historical contexts and that criticism must take these contexts into account, McGann shows how the ideologies embodied in Romantic poetry and theory have shaped and distorted contemporary critical activities.</p></p><p></p><h2>What Is This Thing Called Love: Poems</h2><p><p><strong>Poetry from the author of <em>Tell Me</em>, a finalist for the National Book Award.</strong></p> A chestnut with a white blaze is scorching across the turf towards the finishing post.</p><p>A finalist for the National Book Award, Kim Addonizio has also received a Guggenheim Fellowship, two NEA Fellowships, and a Pushcart Prize. She divides her time between living in Oakland, California, and New York City.Unashamedly populist, and often charming, Addonizio's fourth book of verse explores the pleasures of sex, the pains of mourning, the efforts of raising a daughter and the difficulties of minor celebrity, setting all her musings and recollections in a style two parts confessional, one part stand-up comedy, and one part talking blues. Addonizio (Tell Me) makes reference both to famous bluesmen (Robert Johnson) and to their repetition-based forms. The first two parts of this five-part collection repeat single subjects as well: first the erotic life (a "31-year-old lover" "stands naked in my bedroom and nothing/ has harmed him yet"), and then the dead ("no real grief left/ for the man who was my father"). Exploring "the way of the world/ the sorrowful versus the happy," the rest of Addonizio's book takes up lighter, more varied subjects, often with a defter hand: "This Poem Wants to Be a Rock and Roll Song So Bad" self-mockingly "captures the essence of today's youth," while "This Poem Is in Recovery" promises "I'm not going to get drunk and take off my clothes/ to sign my book for you." One poem adapts a form from Billy Collins, another responds (by name) to Sharon Olds: others recall the candid representations of (for example) Molly Peacock. Addonizio's in-your-face persona and her avoidance of technical difficulty should help her attract the wide audience she explicitly invites.<br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The rules couldn't be easier--one player is designated "it" and must try to tag out one of the others. What most of us don't realize is that this simple chase game is in fact an application of pursuit theory, and that the same principles of games like tag, dodgeball, and hide-and-seek are at play in military strategy, high-seas chases by the Coast Guard, even romantic pursuits. In <i>Chases and Escapes</i>, Paul Nahin gives us the first complete history of this fascinating area of mathematics.</p><br><p> Writing in an accessible style that has been enjoyed by popular-math enthusiasts everywhere, Nahin traces the development of modern pursuit theory from its classical analytical beginnings to the present day. Along the way, he informs his mathematical discussions with fun facts and captivating stories. Nahin invites readers to explore the different approaches to solving various chase-and-escape problems. He draws upon game theory, geometry, linear algebra, target-tracking algorithms--and much more. Nahin offers an array of challenging puzzles for beginners on up, providing historical background for each problem and explaining how each one can be applied more broadly. <i>Chases and Escapes</i> includes solutions to all problems and provides computer programs that readers can use for their own cutting-edge analysis.</p><br><p> This informative and entertaining book is the first comprehensive treatment of the subject, one that is sure to appeal to anyone interested in the mathematics that underlie the all-too-human endeavor of pursuit and evasion.</p></p><p><p>"Nahin provides beautiful applications of calculus, differential equations, and game theory.

The essays in this volume provide a clear and systematic exegesis of Spinoza&#39;s thought informed by the most recent scholarship. They cover his metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of science, psychology, ethics, political theory, theology, and scriptural interpretation, as well as his life and influence on later thinkers.</p><p>"I do not presume to have discovered the best philosophy," Spinoza once wrote, "but I know that I understand the true one." Understanding the philosophy of Spinoza is not easy, to be sure, but <i>The Cambridge Companion to Spinoza</i> is intended to help. Aimed at the novice and the specialist alike, it contains 10 essays contributed by scholars who are among the foremost authorities on Spinoza's thought. "Taken as a whole," editor Don Garrett writes, "the essays in this volume present a detailed, coherent, and--I believe--accurate portrait of one of the most original and fruitful thinkers that humankind has yet produced." <p> The <i>Companion</i> is almost certainly the best anthology on Spinoza's philosophy presently available, and his major work, <i>Ethics</i>, is naturally at its center. Among the high points in Jonathan Bennett's compendious essay on Spinoza's metaphysics is his discussion of "size neutrality"--the claim that small things differ from large ones only in size--which is memorably described as "a blank check that philosophers wrote on Nature's bank and that did not visibly bounce until late in the 19th century." Other essays on <i>Ethics</i> deal with Spinoza's views on epistemology, the philosophy of science, the philosophy of mind, and--unsurprisingly--ethics. Concerning other aspects of Spinoza's work, Edwin Curley's essay, delightfully titled "Kissinger, Spinoza, and Genghis Khan," argues that Spinoza's political philosophy is essentially Machiavellian; Spinoza's contributions to theology and Bible scholarship are carefully dealt with by the late Alan Donagan and Richard H.

While previous scholarship has seen Christian reactions to pagan educational culture as the product of an empire-wide process of development, Edward J. Watts crafts two narratives that reveal how differently education was shaped by the local power structures and urban contexts of each city. Touching on the careers of Herodes Atticus, Proclus, Damascius, Ammonius Saccas, Origen, Hypatia, and Olympiodorus; and events including the Herulian sack of Athens, the closing of the Athenian Neoplatonic school under Justinian, the rise of Arian Christianity, and the sack of the Serapeum, he shows that by the sixth century, Athens and Alexandria had two distinct, locally determined, approaches to pagan teaching that had their roots in the unique historical relationships between city and school.</p><p><b>Edward J.

This new edition has been updated to reflect recent events, up to and including the G20 summit in July 2010 and the broad consensus to reduce government spending that emerged from it. Marazzi, a leading figure in the European postfordist movement, argues that the processes of financialization are not simply irregularities between the traditional categories of wages, rent, and profit, but rather a new type of accumulation adapted to the processes of social and cognitive production today. The financial crisis, he contends, is a fundamental component of contemporary accumulation and not a classic lack of economic growth. Marazzi shows that individual debt and the management of financial markets are actually techniques for governing the transformations of immaterial labor, general intellect, and social cooperation. The financial crisis has radically undermined the very concept of unilateral and multilateral economico-political hegemony, and Marazzi discusses efforts toward a new geomonetary order that have emerged around the globe in response. Offering a radically new understanding of the current stage of international economics as well as crucial post-Marxist guidance for confronting capitalism in its newest form, <i>The Violence of Financial Capitalism</i> is a valuable addition to the contemporary arsenal of postfordist thought. This edition includes the glossary of the esoteric neolanguage of financial capitalism&#x2015;&#x201d;Words in Crisis,&#x201d; from &#x201c;AAA&#x201d; to &#x201c;toxic asset&#x201d;&#x2015;written for the first English-language edition, and offers a new afterword by Marazzi. </p></p><p>Christian Marazzi was born in Lugano, Switzerland, in 1951.

Whether these tragic deaths could have been avoided is still debatable, but what seems clear is that the events in Texas have broad implications for religious freedom in America.<br><br>James Tabor and Eugene Gallagher's bold examination of the Waco story offers the first balanced account of the siege. They try to understand what really happened in Waco: What brought the Branch Davidians to Mount Carmel? Why did the government attack? How did the media affect events? The authors address the accusations of illegal weapons possession, strange sexual practices, and child abuse that were made against David Koresh and his followers. Without attempting to excuse such actions, they point out that the public has not heard the complete story and that many media reports were distorted.<br><br>The authors have carefully studied the Davidian movement, analyzing the theology and biblical interpretation that were so central to the group's functioning. They also consider how two decades of intense activity against so-called cults have influenced public perceptions of unorthodox religions.<br><br>In exploring our fear of unconventional religious groups and how such fear curtails our ability to tolerate religious differences, <i>Why Waco?</i> is an unsettling wake-up call. Using the events at Mount Carmel as a cautionary tale, the authors challenge all Americans, including government officials and media representatives, to closely examine our national commitment to religious freedom.</p><p>"The label "cult" can become a license to kill. . . . A courageous religious scholar, James Tabor, understanding what was at stake, tried valiantly to prevent the tragedy at Waco. Persevering in its wake, he and Eugene Gallagher thoroughly investigated the background, participants, and events leading to the destruction of the Mount Carmel Church and its members. Their findings are presented in this critically important book."&#x2014;Ramsey Clark, former Attorney General<br><br>"Here, at last, is a glimpse of 'the other side' of the tragic confrontation. . . . The authors offer an alternative to the common wisdom about Waco as well as a critique of the anti-cult ideology that helped misdefine the situation and bring about its fateful&#x2014;and fatal&#x2014;results."&#x2014;Dean M. Kelley, Counselor on Religious Liberty, National Council of Churches<br><br>"For public debate on a serious issue facing our society, this book deserves wide and sober reading."&#x2014;John R.

Not a step-by-step construction manual, it teaches the fundamental principles of integrating house, garden, and landscape by making art from simple groupings of rocks, plants, and water and opening Japanese symbolism to elements with universal significance, such as water and paths. Included is an extensive encyclopedia of appropriate plants to use based on creating and defining particular eco-regions.</p><p>Patricia Jonas is the director of library services at Brooklyn Botanic Garden. She lived in Japan for two years, visiting and studying Japanese gardens. She lives in New York City.American gardeners have a penchant for emulating gardens of other cultures--English cottage gardens, or French gardens based on the paintings of Monet--and while they may be equally enthusiastic about creating Japanese-style gardens, most go no further than the conventional "stone-pagoda-and-bamboo" school of design. Enter the latest offering in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's renowned 21st-century Gardening series. Offering a "how-to" approach, this compilation of essays focuses on the inherent principles and practices <i>behind</i> Japanese landscape design. From creating garden paths to installing rocks and using water, the essential elements of Japanese gardens are addressed from both philosophical and practical points of view. The enthusiast is encouraged to be less concerned about a strict adherence to rules in favor of developing a deeper appreciation for technique, a greater understanding of purpose. Complemented by an extensive encyclopedia of suitable plants, this guide will enable the gardener to design a Japanese-style landscape that acknowledges its inspiration without resorting to stereotypical cliches. <i>Carol Haggas</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

The text stresses the application of mathematics to problem solving rather than derivation of theory. Numerous case studies cultivate student understanding of the occurrence and movement of ground water in a variety of geologic settings.PREFACE <p> Hydrogeology is now considered to be a core course in the curriculum of undergraduate geology programs as well as many fields of engineering. There is ongoing demand for persons with training in hydrogeology by consulting organizations, state and federal regulatory agencies, and industrial firms. Most of the employment in hydrogeology is in the environmental area. This is a book that will help prepare students for either a career in hydrogeology or in other areas of environmental science and engineering where a strong background in hydrogeology is needed. </p><p> Applied Hydrogeology is intended as a textbook for an introductory course in hydrogeology taught either at the advanced undergraduate level, or as a dual-level undergraduate/graduate course. It is also useful in helping individuals who are preparing to take state examinations for professional registration as a hydrologist or hydrogeologist. It can be found as a reference book in the personal library of many working professionals. </p><p> The reader is expected to have a working knowledge of college algebra, and calculus is helpful, but not necessary, for practical understanding of the material. A background in college chemistry is necessary to understand the chapter on water chemistry. The book stresses the application of mathematics to problem-solving rather than the derivation of theory. To this end you will find many example problems with step-by-step solutions. Case studies in many chapters enhance understanding of the occurrence and movement of ground water in a variety of geological settings. A glossary of hydrogeological terms makes this book a valuable reference. </p><p> The fourth edition contains new case studies and end-of-chapter problems. In most cases the problems are paired. An odd-numbered problem will have the answer given in a section in the back of the book, followed by an even-numbered problem without the answer. Step-by-step solutions to the odd-numbered problems can also be found at the Applied Hydrogeology web page: appliedhydrogeology. Many chapters in the fourth edition also contain a section called Analysis, with non-numerical questions. The use of spreadsheet programs, such as Microsoftï¿½ Excel, in hydrogeology is introduced here. </p><p> Included with the text are working student versions of three computer programs that are used by ground-water professionals. They have been furnished free of charge by the software publishers. No technical support is furnished for these programs, either by the author or the software publisher. However, they are easy to use and come with tutorials and documentation on the CD-ROM. </p><p> The following reviewers provided helpful suggestions for the fourth edition: Gary S. Johnson, University of Idaho; Larry Murdoch, Clemson University; Claude Epstein, Richard Stockton College of New Jersey; David L. Brown, California State University at Chico; F.

Why does the past affect the future and not the other way around? What does quantum mechanics really tell us about the world? In this important and accessible book, Huw Price throws fascinating new light on some of the great mysteries of modern physics, and connects them in a wholly original way.<br> Price begins with the mystery of the arrow of time. Why, for example, does disorder always increase, as required by the second law of thermodynamics? Price shows that, for over a century, most physicists have thought about these problems the wrong way. Misled by the human perspective from within time, which distorts and exaggerates the differences between past and future, they have fallen victim to what Price calls the "double standard fallacy": proposed explanations of the difference between the past and the future turn out to rely on a difference which has been slipped in at the beginning, when the physicists themselves treat the past and future in different ways. To avoid this fallacy, Price argues, we need to overcome our natural tendency to think about the past and the future differently. We need to imagine a point outside time -- an Archimedean "view from nowhen" -- from which to observe time in an unbiased way.<br> Offering a lively criticism of many major modern physicists, including Richard Feynman and Stephen Hawking, Price shows that this fallacy remains common in physics today -- for example, when contemporary cosmologists theorize about the eventual fate of the universe. The "big bang" theory normally assumes that the beginning and end of the universe will be very different. But if we are to avoid the double standard fallacy, we need to consider time symmetrically, and take seriously the possibility that the arrow of time may reverse when the universe recollapses into a "big crunch."<br> Price then turns to the greatest mystery of modern physics, the meaning of quantum theory. He argues that in missing the Archimedean viewpoint, modern physics has missed a radical and attractive solution to many of the apparent paradoxes of quantum physics. Many consequences of quantum theory appear counterintuitive, such as Schrodinger's Cat, whose condition seems undetermined until observed, and Bell's Theorem, which suggests a spooky "nonlocality," where events happening simultaneously in different places seem to affect each other directly. Price shows that these paradoxes can be avoided by allowing that at the quantum level the future does, indeed, affect the past. This demystifies nonlocality, and supports Einstein's unpopular intuition that quantum theory describes an objective world, existing independently of human observers: the Cat is alive or dead, even when nobody looks. So interpreted, Price argues, quantum mechanics is simply the kind of theory we ought to have expected in microphysics -- from the symmetric standpoint.<br><em>Time's Arrow and Archimedes' Point</em> presents an innovative and controversial view of time and contemporary physics. In this exciting book, Price urges physicists, philosophers, and anyone who has ever pondered the mysteries of time to look at the world from the fresh perspective of Archimedes' Point and gain a deeper understanding of ourselves, the universe around us, and our own place in time.<br></p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Huw Price</strong> is Reader in Philosophy at the University of Sydney, Australia. He is the author of <em>Facts and the Function of Truth</em> (1988) and a wide range of articles in leading journals such as <em>The Journal of Philosophy</em>, <em>Mind</em>, and <em>Nature</em>.<br><br>"Particularly illuminating in that Price shows how philosophers and physicists have failed to see temporal symmetries because of the influence of their own temporally asymmetric perspective.... A real advance in the interpretation of quantum mechanics. Not only philosophy of science but theoretical physicists should be excited about by this lovely book."--J.J.C. Smart, Emeritus Professor, Australian National University<p></p><br></p><h2>The Beacon at Alexandria</h2><p>In the first century Roman Empire, Charis, a young woman determined to become a doctor, flees from an arranged marriage, and, disguised as a eunuch, journeys to Alexandria to continue her studies</p><p>When Charis learns that her father has betrothed her to the hated Roman governor Festinus, she enlists the aid of her brother and flees to Alexandria.

This was the period of art as great fashion.</p><p>Dakers is professor of cultural history at Central SaiBy the middle of the 19th century, English artists and designers had achieved wealth and status, becoming influential members of society. From about 1850 on, the most prestigious artists--led by George Frederic Leighton--settled in the Holland Park section of London. Their homes were exquisite creations, beautifully furnished, that were open to the public once a year on "show Sunday." (To this day, these miniature palaces remain some of the most expensive homes in London.) Dakers (cultural history, Central St. Martins Coll. of Art and Design) examines the relationships among the artists, their beautiful studio-homes, and their circle of fellow artists and patrons--no longer the aristocracy but rather merchants, bankers, and industrialists who wanted not Old Masters but works by living artists. This is truly a groundbreaking work, carefully written and beautifully produced, about an important group of artists.

Yet, Puerto Rican participation and contributions to hip hop have often been downplayed and even completely ignored. And when their presence has been acknowledged, it has frequently been misinterpreted as a defection from Puerto Rican culture and identity, into the African American camp. But nothing could be further from the truth. Through hip hop, Puerto Ricans have simply stretched the boundaries of Puerto Ricanness and latinidad.</p><p>RAQUEL RIVERA is a freelance journalist and has a Ph.D. in Sociology from CUNY. Her articles have appeared in a number of diverse publications both regionally and nationally, from <em>Mambo Montage: The Latinization of New York</em>, a book of essays published by Columbia University Press, to newspapers like <em>El Diario/La Prensa</em> and <em>Hoy</em> in New York; <em>El Nuevo Dï¿½a, The San Juan Star</em> and <em>Claridad</em> in Puerto Rico, and in magazines like <em>Critï¿½cas, New York Latino, In the House</em> and <em>Stress</em>.In this brief, scholarly book, freelance journalist Rivera acknowledges Puerto Ricans for their contributions to hip-hop music over the past 30 years. It's debatable just how much credit is deserved, considering Rivera comes up with only a handful of recognizable players who predate the culture-wide "Latino boom" of the past few years-Fat Joe, Angie Martinez and the late Big Punisher, the biggest-selling Latino rapper of all time. But she still crafts a persuasive revisionist history through painstaking research and original reporting. She points out that while Puerto Ricans and African-Americans collaborated to create hip-hop in the early 1970s South Bronx and shared a ghetto-based entitlement, Puerto Ricans had to "step lightly through the identity minefield." For much of the 1980s and '90s, Puerto Ricans' "participation and entitlement" were questioned as hip-hop became more exclusively African American. Many Puerto Rican performers further alienated themselves from the hip-hop center by embracing Latino culture and rapping in Spanish, while others identified more strongly with African Americans and downplayed their Caribbean roots. Since the mid-'90s, of course, hip-hop has begun to embrace Latino culture (such as J. Lo) for better or worse; Rivera is troubled by rap's Latino stereotypes of sexy "Butta Pecan Ricans" and "tough-guy papi chulos." The only serious difficulty with this useful book is in navigating Rivera's oft-impenetrable academese ("Behind inclusion lies the specter of subsumption and dismissal"). Then again, Rivera, who has a doctorate in sociology, may have intended this work for a liberal arts classroom: it's clearly not for the b-boys and b-girls. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Crime and Everyday Life</h2><p><p><b>Crime and Everyday Life, Fourth Edition</b>, provides an illuminating glimpse into roots of criminal behavior, explaining how crime can touch us all in both small and large ways.

It adds to the literature on criminology and gives validity to routine activities theory as a cogent and up-to-date explanation of crime.

They all argue that the unique social and cultural position Black students occupy, in a society which often devalues and stereotypes African American identity, fundamentally shapes students' experience of school and sets up unique obstacles. And they all argue that a proper understanding of the forces at work can lead to practical, powerful methods for promoting high achievement at all levels.<br><br>Theresa Perry argues that African-American students face dilemmas, founded in the experience of race and ethnicity in America, that make the task of achievement distinctive and difficult. (For instance: "How do I commit myself to achieve, to work hard over time in school, if I cannot predict when or under what circumstances this hard work will be acknowledged and recognized?") She uncovers a rich and powerful African- American philosophy of education, historically forged against such obstacles and capable of addressing them, by reading African-American narratives from Frederick Douglass to Maya Angelou. She carefully critiques the most popular theoretical explanations for group differences in achievement. And she lays out how educators today-in a postcivil rights era-can draw on theory and on the historical power of the African-American philosophy and tradition of education to reorganize the school experience of African-American students. <br><br>Claude Steele reports stunningly clear empirical psychological evidence that when Black students believe they are being judged as members of a stereotyped group rather than as individuals, they do worse on tests. He finds the mechanism, which he calls "stereotype threat," to be a quite general one, affecting women's performance in mathematics, for instance, where stereotypes about gender operate. He analyzes the subtle psychology of stereotype threat and reflects on the broad implications of his research for education, suggesting techniques-based again on evidence from controlled psychological experiments-that teachers and mentors and schools can use to counter stereotype threat's powerful effect. <br><br>Asa Hilliard's ends essay, against a variety of false theories and misguided views of African American achievement, and focuses on actual schools and programs and teachers around the country that allow African-American students achieve at high levels, describing what they are like and what makes them work. <br><br><i>Young, Gifted, and Black</i> will change the way we think and talk about African American student achievement and will be necessary reading on this topic for years to come.</p><p><b>Theresa Perry</b>&nbsp;is Professor of Africana Studies and Education at Simmons College.

From the novice to the connoisseur, wine lovers will be enlightened, informed and enchanted by this delightful one-volume guide to the world of wine. Beautifully designed and unrivalled in its scope, it is edited under the keen supervision of Jancis Robinson, heralded by <em>The Wine Advocate</em> as "perhaps the most gifted of all wine writers writing today," and one of the few journalists to pass the notoriously difficult Master of Wine exams. Going deeper than traditional buyer's guides and wine atlases, the <em>Companion</em> sought out contributions and advice from more than 70 authorities from around the world, including more than a dozen Masters of Wine. Its 3,000 alphabetically arranged entries range from brief entries--What is a <em>blanc de noirs</em>? Where is Chateau Latour?--to fascinating longer essays on the intricacies of wine scoring, wine aging, and the nuances of judging a wine's color, aroma and flavor. The sumptuous illustrations include 32 stunning full color plates and 31 maps of every major wine region.<br>As readable as it is comprehensive, the <em>Companion</em> recognizes wine in all its many roles--as a commercial commodity, as a complex and subtle work of art, and, of course, as a source of great pleasure. Ranging from Abruzzi and armagnac to Zimbabwe and Zinfandel, from Dionysian revels in ancient Greece to today's leading wine research centers, the entries explore all aspects of wine appreciation, the wine trade, and wine-making, including the very latest advances in viticulture and enology. All technical terms are fully explained, and the hundreds of useful drawings and photographs illustrate key processes. From the Napa Valley to Burgundy to China's Shandung peninsula, here are in-depth discussions of the climates, personalities, and grape varieties that have shaped the great wine regions of the world. Other single subject entries include the great winemakers, vintner's terms, hundreds of individual grape varieties, and some of the important names in the wine world, including American wine judge Robert Parker, and Michael Broadbent, head of Christie's Wine Department.<br>The <em>Companion's</em> stellar cast of contributors and consultants include wine correspondents, judges, wine merchants, historians, practical scientists, specialists from some of the world's leading institutions for the study of wine, including Professor A. Dinsmoor Webb of the University of California at Davis, and even a barrel broker.

They are small, elusive, and are named for their heads, which are shaped like miniature ponies with tiny snouts. They swim slowly upright by rapidly fanning their delicate dorsal fin, coil their tails to anchor themselves in a drift, and spend days in a dancing courtship. Afterward, it is the male who carries the female&#x2019;s eggs in his pouch and hatches the young. Seahorses are found worldwide, and they are highly sensitive to environmental destruction and disturbance, making them the flagship species for shallow-water habitat conservation. They are as ecologically important as they are beautiful.<br><br><i>Seahorses </i>celebrates the remarkable variety of seahorse species as well as their exquisiteness. 57 species, including seadragons and pipefish, are presented in lush, life-size photographs alongside descriptive drawings, and each entry includes detailed and up-to-date information on natural history and conservation. Sara Lourie, a foremost expert on seahorse taxonomy, presents captivating stories of species that range from less than an inch to over a foot in height, while highlighting recent discoveries and ecological concerns. Accessibly written, but comprehensive in scope, this book will be a stunning and invaluable reference on seahorse evolution, biology, habitat, and behavior.<br><br> Masters of camouflage and rarely seen, seahorses continue to be a fascinating subject of active research.

This guide covers every one of the 42 known species of seahorses, plus 15 additional relatives, including the seadragon. In addition to beautiful color photographs of all but the rarest species, the descriptions nicely summarize what is known about the distribution, reproduction, and identifying characters of each. The really striking feature, however, is an elegantly simple one: inclusion of a life-sized shadow/silhouette of each species. It is rather astounding to see that some of the pygmy seahorses are literally no larger than the average housefly! . . .

The early November air was chilly but crisp and invigorating. By the thousands, soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division, many of whom were hard-core survivors of bitter fighting in North Africa and Sicily, descended wooden gangways and set foot upon the venerable soil of England. A band played "Dixie," followed by "The Sidewalks of New York." As the soldiers made their way to troop trains, a bevy of sharply contrasting emotions pervaded their ranks. Some were just happy to be out of combat. Many daydreamed about the pleasures Britain offered-pubs, beer, liquor, sightseeing, shelter, running water, but most of all, women. Some of those who had been with the division during its pre-combat training in Britain the year before looked forward to renewing acquaintances with British friends. In several instances, men were so excited that they let out spontaneous whoops of joy. "You can imagine the crescendo that crushed the ears of all within miles," Captain Joe Dawson, a company commander, wrote to his family in an attempt to describe the exaltation of his men.<br><br> But there was an undercurrent of tension and gloom, too. The return to England could only mean one thing: the Big Red One was returning to combat, probably in the forthcoming invasion of Hitler's Europe. After nearly a year of fighting, and a slew of victories in the Mediterranean theater, many of the soldiers felt they had earned the right to go home. Already fiercely proud of their outfit, and resentful of most outside authority, they had developed a cynical world-weariness that, for some, bordered on self-pity. After the Sicily campaign, hopeful rumors had spread that the division would be rotated back to the States to train new recruits. When the men boarded ships and found out they were heading to England, and thus eventually back to action, "it caused," in the recollection of one rifleman, "a lot of trouble among the soldiers, a lot of unrest and anger." For Lieutenant John Downing and his men, "the hope of going to the States . . . died hard. We could be sure . . . if we didn't go home this time, we wouldn't go home until the end of the war."<br><br> Many of the veterans felt this was unfair and unnecessary. They complained bitterly about the idea of going back into combat. After all, they had been fortunate enough to survive to this point; more prolonged action almost certainly meant that their chances of survival would be diminished. A man could evade the law of averages only so long before his luck ran out. "Their feeling was there must be other infantry units in the United States Army that could be utilized in the assault on Western Europe," Private Steve Kellman explained. There were, of course, other units, but none quite like the Big Red One. The division's experience in amphibious assaults made it indispensable to invasion planners (not to mention its familiarity in the very sort of town fighting, river crossings, mountain fighting, and combined arms maneuver warfare that would follow in the months after the invasion). Among the American infantry divisions available for the coming invasion of Omaha beach, none had actually assaulted a hostile shore. Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, commander of the First Army, with control over all U.S. ground forces in the coming invasion, knew this all too well. "Although I disliked subjecting the 1st to still another major landing," he wrote, "I felt that as commander I had no other choice. My job was to get ashore, establish a lodgment, and destroy the German. In the accomplishment of that mission, there was little room for the niceties of justice. I felt compelled to employ the best troops I had. As a result the division that deserved compassion as a reward for its previous ordeals now became the inevitable choice for our most difficult job." In essence, they could not be spared. The task ahead was far too important and far too challenging.<br> At Liverpool, the troops boarded trains that took them to southern England, where they would settle in and begin a new round of training. Many were miffed at the standing order to remove, for reasons of secrecy, shoulder patches and all other indicators of their unit affiliation. The lack of identifying unit insignia made them look like newly arrived stateside replacements instead of proud combat veterans. It seemed a direct affront to their pride and status. Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Wright, the division quartermaster, was so incensed at the order that he simply refused to follow it. Military police caught him, wrote him up, and referred his case to the First Army Provost Marshal. His defiance eventually evaporated, but only after the threat of a court-martial. He and thousands of other like-minded veterans grumbled, but swallowed their pride and complied with the order.<br><br> Even worse, in the view of many Big Red One soldiers, was something else that had happened near the end of the Sicily campaign. Bradley had decided to relieve Major General Terry de la Mesa Allen, the 1st Division's popular and colorful commanding officer. Allen was a soldier's soldier, a down-to-earth cavalryman who loved polo, whiskey, and earthy language. The son of a West Point graduate and the grandson of a Civil War officer, he was born to be a soldier. As a young man, Allen had washed out of West Point because of his independent nature and maverick tendencies, a dismissal that must have smarted for the scion of such a distinguished military family. True to his resilient nature, though, he rebounded from the setback to earn a degree from the Catholic University of America and a subsequent Regular Army commission. Allen's personality meshed perfectly with the independent professionalism of the 1st Infantry Division.<br><br> In combat, he was the embodiment of an inspirational commander-courageous, relentless, and energetic-the sort of general who circulated easily among subordinates from the lowest-ranking private to staff officers. On the Tunisian front, he had made a point of regularly visiting the forward positions and speaking to each man personally. "There is nothing that is more inspiring than to have a general walking about the front lines when the bullets are flying, talking with the men," one of his aides wrote about him in a letter home. "He doesn't know what the word fear is and he is just like a hypodermic to the men of his command."<br><br> He had little patience for niceties. In action, he dressed in a simple, rumpled olive-drab uniform, helmet often askew or at his side, smoking cigarettes, grinning, tossing around one-liners. He was a natural backslapper and storyteller. He enjoyed an easy familiarity with his men, yet he managed to maintain a strong command presence. Almost everyone who served in the 1st had encountered him firsthand and had come to love him, in part because of his magnetic personality, in part because of his competence, but mostly because of his obvious concern for their welfare. "Do your job," he once told his division. "We don't want . . . dead heroes. We're not out for glory. We're here to do a dirty, stinking job." Over the many months of combat in North Africa and Sicily, he had inculcated an aggressive spirit in his division. True to his cavalry roots, he believed in swift maneuvers, slash and dash, night attacks and esprit de corps.<br><br> He cared little for his own promotion or his postwar military career. Command of the unit was the limit of his ambition. The men sensed that they were his first priority, and they loved him for it. "General Allen was loved by his soldiers because he really cared about them," Corporal Sam Fuller once wrote. "He didn't give a damn about playing politics or being famous." Allen had no tolerance for anyone who messed with his boys, whether that meant the Germans or higher command. In combat, this attitude contributed to success, but when the unit was off the line, it sometimes led to disciplinary problems. In the Mediterranean, the 1st earned a reputation as a hard-fighting outfit on the line, but a hard-drinking, rebellious, troublemaking group away from combat, contemptuous of rear-echelon troops, higher authority, and, for that matter, anyone who wasn't affiliated with the division. Allen seemed not only to tolerate this attitude but to encourage it, at least in the view of Bradley, George Patton, Dwight Eisenhower, and other senior officers in the theater. The most notorious example occurred in the spring of 1943, after the Tunisia campaign. The combat-weary men of the division yearned to visit the bars and brothels of Oran, a city they had actually captured during the initial invasion of North Africa back in the fall of 1942. However, only soldiers in rear-echelon-style khaki uniforms were allowed into the city. The Big Red One soldiers were still clothed in the same filthy olive-drab wool uniforms they had worn all winter during the hard fighting among the hills of Tunisia. The combat men felt that if anyone should enjoy the pleasures of Oran, it should be the front-line soldiers who routinely risked their lives. Therefore, they deeply resented being excluded from the city at the expense of the "typewriter commandos," as they often referred to the service troops.<br><br> Allen was clearly sympathetic to the views of his men. He defied the off-limits order and issued passes for his soldiers to enjoy some R&amp;R in the city. A substantial amount of brawling, drinking, and mayhem ensued, involving both officers and enlisted men. "I can still remember the feeling I had when I landed a punch to some fat major's belly," Captain Edward Kuehn said. "We had taken Oran before, and we had lost a lot of good men doing it. Rearguard troops were not going to keep us from taking it this time, either." When Patton complained to Allen about the behavior of his soldiers, and demanded that he rein them in, Allen backed them to the hilt. "The troops have been in the line for six goddamned months," he exclaimed. "Let them celebrate getting back alive. It will stop soon." This was a revealing reaction and decision on Allen's part. A more career-conscious officer would have been eager to do the bidding of his superiors, regardless of what his men might have thought about that. Allen was different. Certainly his soldiers came first on his list of priorities, but perhaps he was also eager to remain popular among them even if that meant alienating the higher-ups.<br><br> In the view of senior officers, the Oran clashes represented more than just the usual tension between combat soldiers and rear-echelon types. Bradley, for instance, came to believe that a distinct whiff of parochialism, self-pity, and disregard for discipline and the chain of command emanated from the Big Red One. The soldiers had become a little too loyal to Allen and his equally charismatic assistant division commander, Ted Roosevelt, son of the former president. "Roosevelt was too much like Allen," Bradley wrote. "They looked upon discipline as an unwelcome crutch to be used by less able and personable commanders." The intense loyalty the troops held for these two generals was, in Bradley's estimation, coming at the expense of the greater loyalty soldiers owed to the Army as a whole. "Under Allen the 1st Division had become increasingly temperamental, disdainful of both regulations and senior commands," Bradley wrote. "It thought itself exempt from the need for discipline by virtue of its months on the line. And it believed itself the only division carrying its fair share of the war. Allen had become too much of an individualist to submerge himself without friction in the group undertakings of war." For the low-key Bradley, a duty-first man who disdained talented mavericks and nonconformity as a whole, the only sensible course of action was to remove Allen. In August 1943, near the end of the Sicily campaign, he fired him. Roosevelt also got the ax, in part because Bradley felt that he, too, had failed to enforce proper discipline and also because "Allen . . . would feel deeply hurt if he were to leave the division and Roosevelt were to remain." Both Patton and Eisenhower concurred with the decision.<br><br> Word of the firings hit the division like a sledgehammer. It was hard for the men to understand why such a successful commander had been cashiered. Some were resentful over Allen's relief; their bitterness hardened into anger at the brass and, ironically, an even more insular attitude about their division's greatness and the uselessness of all outsiders. Those who were a bit more even-tempered, like Lieutenant John Downing, simply thought of it as "a bad omen. If a new general took command, we could be sure we would continue on somewhere in combat." These suppositions were, of course, absolutely correct. Other men were simply mystified or sad. "He was the best liked commander that we ever had," Captain Charles Murphy, a company commander, told an interviewer decades later. On the evening Allen left to go home, Captain Dawson, who had worked closely with him, wrote to his family about the melancholy mood that pervaded the ranks: "Terry left tonight, and with him went a record unequaled by any general officer in the divisions of the U.S. Army. We've been through a lot and we all feel keenly sad about his going."<br><br> Under these circumstances, a lot was riding on Bradley's selection of a replacement for Allen. Fortunately, he made a very wise choice in Major General Clarence Huebner, a man whose personality could hardly have been more different from Allen's, but whose competence and courage were every bit his equal. Whereas Allen was born to soldiering, Huebner was drawn to it. While Allen's success was a testament to resilience and charisma, Huebner's was a testament to the Army's culture of meritocracy (at least for white men). Born to a non-military Kansas wheat-farming family, Huebner was educated in a one-room school of the sort that pervaded frontier lore. Hardened by an outdoor life of farm chores, he was an athletic youth, though he was only of medium build and height. He played football, baseball, and basketball in high school. During track season, he was a pole-vaulter. At the age of twenty, with a high school diploma to his credit, he went to work as a railroad secretary. He had no desire to spend his life as a clerk, though. In 1910 he left the job and decided to join the Army, enlisting as a cook in the 18th Infantry Regiment, a unit that became part of the 1st Division seven years later. Huebner discovered that he was a natural soldier. Over the next seven years, he rocketed from private to master sergeant. In 1916, he passed a competitive examination to become an officer and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in November of that year. By the time the division deployed to France in the spring of 1917, he was a first lieutenant. His combat record in World War I was one of the finest of that or any other war. In eighteen months of frontline leadership, he rose from a first lieutenant, leading a platoon, to a lieutenant colonel, leading a regiment at the tender age of thirty. He earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second-highest award for valor, as well as the Distinguished Service Medal, for outstanding service.

When her husband drinks himself to death, Sarah, a dirt-poor homemaker with no family to rely on and the note on the farm long past due, must find a way for her and young Emerson Bridge to survive. But the more daunting obstacle is Sarah's fear that her mother's words, seared in her memory since she first heard them at the age of six, were a prophesy: "You ain't got you one good mama bone in you, girl."<br>When Sarah reads in the local newspaper that a boy won $680 with his Grand Champion steer at the recent 1951 Fat Cattle Show &amp; Sale, she sees this as their financial salvation and finds a way to get Emerson Bridge a steer from a local farmer to compete in the 1952 show. But the young calf is unsettled at Sarah's farm, crying out in distress and growing louder as the night wears on. Some four miles away, the steer's mother hears his cries and breaks out of a barbed-wire fence to go in search of him. The next morning Sarah finds the young steer quiet, content, and nursing on a large cow. Inspired by the mother cow's act of love, Sarah names her Mama Red. And so Sarah's education in motherhood begins with Mama Red as her teacher. <br>But Luther Dobbins, the man who sold Sarah the steer, has his sights set on winning too, and, like Sarah, he is desperate, but not for money. Dobbins is desperate for glory, wanting to regain his lost grand-champion dynasty, and he will stop at nothing to win. Emboldened by her lessons from Mama Red and her budding mama bone, Sarah is fully committed to victory until she learns the winning steer's ultimate fate. Will she stop at nothing, even if it means betraying her teacher? <br>McClain's writing is distinguished by a sophisticated and detailed portrayal of the day-to-day realities of rural poverty and an authentic sense of time and place that marks the best southern fiction.

He is a traveller into different continents of desire, using his camera to record his discoveries. Western man&#39;s exploration of far-flung countries has always been fundamentally connected with sexual discovery, the locating of the Other as seductive female. In travel there is the latent possibility of liberation -- moving beyond the conventions and inhibitions of your own society. Ommer&#39;s lens perfectly captures that charge of erotic freedom and expression. The Asian Ladies of this volume were photographed in some of the most beautiful places on earth, the tropical regions of the Philippines, Thailand and the South Sea Islands, the idyllic beaches of Tahiti and Fiji. Locations that have inspired artists as diverse as Gauguin and Nerval to produce their finest works. Ommer examines the implicit sexuality of those poetic landscapes, and with the clarity of his sumptuous photographs has created images of yearning and mystery.

In <em>Lone Star Justice</em>, best-selling author Robert M. Utley captures the first hundred years of Ranger history, in a narrative packed with adventures worthy of Zane Grey or Larry McMurtry.<br> The Rangers began in the 1820s as loose groups of citizen soldiers, banding together to chase Indians and Mexicans on the raw Texas frontier. Utley shows how, under the leadership of men like Jack Hays and Ben McCulloch, these fiercely independent fighters were transformed into a well-trained, cohesive team. Armed with a revolutionary new weapon, Samuel Colt's repeating revolver, they became a deadly fighting force, whether battling Comanches on the plains or storming the city of Monterey in the Mexican-American War. As the Rangers evolved from part-time warriors to full-time lawmen by 1874, they learned to face new dangers, including homicidal feuds, labor strikes, and vigilantes turned mobs. They battled train robbers, cattle thieves and other outlaws--it was Rangers, for example, who captured John Wesley Hardin, the most feared gunman in the West.<br> Based on exhaustive research in Texas archives, this is the most authoritative history of the Texas Rangers in over half a century. It will stand alongside other classics of Western history by Robert M. Utley--a vivid portrait of the Old West and of the legendary men who kept the law on the lawless frontier.<br></p><p>The Texas Rangers have alternately been described as "fearless men of sterling character" and "ruthless, brutal, and more lawless than the criminals they pursued." The truth, says Robert M. Utley in <i>Lone Star Justice</i>, "lies somewhere in between the extremes." The Rangers got their start in 1823, and for half a century they were "citizen soldiers periodically mobilized to fight Indians or Mexicans." They were professionalized in 1874, when they became lawmen employed by the state of Texas. Utley summarizes their colorful history under the leadership of figures like Jack Hays and Ben McCulloch. They came to national attention during the Mexican War, when they fought with distinction under Zachary Taylor at Monterey and also served as scouts throughout northern Mexico. As lawmen, they were noted for apprehending fugitives (the murdering outlaw John Wesley Hardin fell to one of their bullets) and controlling mobs, but they were less successful at putting bad guys behind bars (a problem that the author blames on "a defective criminal justice system"). At bottom, <i>Lone Star Justice</i> is a sober-minded but generally admiring assessment of a unique group of men. <i>--John Miller</i><br><strong>Robert M.

He is also an advisor to Granada Studios&#x2019; Sherlock Holmes museum, and he contributed commentaries to the DVD releases of the Basil Rathbone Holmes films.<b>Chapter Twenty-Five</b>Just as Sherlock Holmes scrambled free out on to the ledge, one of his attackers launched himself forward and struck him in the leg. The detective gave a fierce gasp of pain as he wrenched himself free, and then suddenly he found himself falling through darkened space.Blotting the pain of the wound from his mind, Holmes twisted his body, aiming it at the large rhododendron bush below him. He landed spread-eagled atop its leafy branches. It broke his fall, but it was only a temporary resting-place, for the weight of his body was too great to be supported by the bush and he tumbled in an ungainly fashion on to the lawn. At moments like this, Holmes's ability to think and act quickly was remarkable. He knew that if he stayed where he was, he would be captured or more likely killed by the assailants. If he fled, all his efforts that evening would come to nought. There had to be some centre ground. He scrambled awkwardly to his feet, gritting his teeth as the wound in his leg screaming with pain. He ran as fast as he could to the garden wall, and vaulted over on to the pavement. He crouched low against the bole of a large oak tree by the kerb. On the other side of the street he spied a carriage. The driver appeared to be peering at the house in anticipation.Two of the assailants appeared in the garden, one swinging a bulls-eye lantern around wildly.&#x201c;He's scarpered!&#x201d; cried one fellow.&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; replied the other. &#x201c;Never mind him, let's get this bleeder away before the whole neighborhood wakes up.&#x201d;The third man appeared at the door with a large burden over his shoulder, wrapped in a grey blanket. The burden was Patrick Graves. The man blew on a silver whistle and the driver brought the carriage to the gate. Graves was bundled inside, followed by two of the men; the other, obviously the leader, jumped up alongside the driver.&#x201c;Let's go,&#x201d; he croaked, and the carriage set off.Holmes slipped from this hiding-place and ran after the carriage. With iron determination he blotted from his mind the stabbing pain in his leg, and, clutching hold of one of the metal bars running parallel across the back of the coach, he pulled himself forward and managed to secure a foothold on the back of the vehicle. With amazing dexterity for an injured man, he was able to settle himself into a crouching position to the back of the carriage, hanging on in a precarious fashion as the vehicle gained speed. In this manner, he travelled with the abductors through the dark and winding streets of London.Despite his limited vision, Holmes's encyclopaedic knowledge of London allowed him to deduce the direction in which they were travelling. All signs told him that they were headed towards Rotherhithe. The detective clung on for dear life as the carriage swayed and rattled its way east.After some twenty minutes, the roads narrowed and darkened - the frequency of gas lamps diminishing. They were now in the vicinity of the West India Docks - an area of warehouses, giant wharves and silent, uninhabited streets. And then the carriage slowed down as it approached the gates of some huge warehouse. He heard one of the men blow hard on a whistle four times, and, peering around the edge of the carriage, Holmes saw the gates begin to open. Now he had to think fast. Decisions had to be made. Should he drop from the vehicle before he became trapped in the warehouse, or should he risk going inside to face to unknown? Once inside the warehouse, he felt certain that he would be able to discover much more concerning Moriarty's plot to steal the Elephant's Egg. The danger was, of course, that he would be trapped there, thus rendering the knowledge useless. In such situations as this, with his heart racing and his adrenalin pumping, Sherlock Holmes gave way to the emotional rather than the rational response. He stayed with the carriage.It rumbled into the vast and apparently empty warehouse, a great industrial cathedral with a high vaulted ceiling which echoed with the rattle of the carriage. In the distance, Holmes spied a group of men, some of whom were carrying lanterns. The welcoming committee. Nimbly, Holmes jumped from his perch and, keeping to the shadows, he scrambled to a stack of discarded packing-cases by the wall, and hid there. And waited. He was inside and safe for the moment. And then the doors of the warehouse closed with an echoing clang. He was inside, but trapped.Graves was unceremoniously unloaded from the carriage as the group of men, three in all, approached. Holmes recognised one of them - Scoular, one of Moriarty's lieutenants. He seemed to be in charge.&#x201c;You have our prize?&#x201d; he asked, pointing at Graves.&#x201c;We've got him. He's groggy now, but he's only had a few drops of the old chlory. He'll be right as rain shortly,&#x201d; said the leader of the abductors, the one who had hit Holmes from behind.&#x201c;Was there any trouble?&#x201d; asked Scoular, his face a cold mask.&#x201c;A little. Some geezer tried to interfere.&#x201d;&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; said another. &#x201c;Called himself Sherlock Holmes.&#x201d;Scoular's eyes narrowed. &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;&#x201c;We gave him what for, and he scarpered.&#x201d;&#x201c;You fools! He should have been silenced!&#x201d;&#x201c;He was a very slippery customer.&#x201d;&#x201c;There were three of you.&#x201d;Scoular's observation hushed the men for a moment, and then the leader piped up again: &#x201c;But we had Graves to deal with as well, and we got him for you.&#x201d;Scoular nodded, and turned to his confederates. &#x201c;Maxwell, you take care of Mr. Graves; and Jenson, pay our friends here and make sure they leave the premises with some speed.&#x201d; He looked up at the driver of the carriage. &#x201c;Take them back to the city and drop them somewhere quiet.&#x201d;The bigger of the two men took Grave's limp body and hoisted it over his shoulder, like a roll of carpet. The abductors were paid off, and within minutes the carriage had departed, taking its three passengers with it.Holding his lantern aloft, Scoular made his way back down towards the far end of the warehouse, accompanied by his two accomplices, one of whom bore the limp frame of Patrick Graves.Sherlock Holmes followed them at a distance, keeping to the sides of the building and beyond the feeble rays of the lantern.The men halted, and suddenly a bright shaft of yellow light shot up from the floor of the warehouse, sending a golden glow up into the rafters. Silently, Holmes dropped to the ground. He saw that Scoular had opened a trap-door, and it was from here that the light was emanating. Without a word, the men disappeared from sight and then with the same suddenness of its arrival, the bright beam of illumination vanished as the trap-door slammed shut. The detective was left alone in the Stygian gloom and silence. It was as though he had been witness to a strange shadow-play, and now the show was over. But the show was not over, he determined. This was merely an interval. He had come this far; it would be futile to give up now. He knew that this was the closest he'd ever been to Professor Moriarty, and he intended to get even closer. Somewhere above him a bat, disturbed by the sudden shaft of light, fluttered briefly from one rafter to another and then settled again.After five minutes, when his eyes had fully acclimatized to the darkness, which was softened only by the moonlight that struggled through the grime on the row of windows placed up the wall near the roof, Sherlock Holmes rose to his feet. His leg still ached and he could feel the wetness of the warm blood seeping through his trouser leg, but he ignored it. He had to ignore it. There were greater concerns at issue here. Slowly he approached the trap-door, and with his heart in his mouth, he gently tugged at the rope-ring which raised it. Again, yellow light escaped into the warehouse. He saw that there was a staircase which led downwards to what appeared to be a narrow corridor. Holmes noted with surprise that this was expensively panelled and carpeted.Like a man operating underwater, he slipped through the aperture and gently replaced the trap-door. <i>Trap-door</i>, he thought. How appropriate. He was now trapped within the lair of London's greatest criminal. And he walked into this trap himself. With a wry grin, he made his way down the staircase.At the bottom, he listened, straining his ears for any sound. Remarkably, there was none - just a hissing silence. He moved along the corridor and soon came upon two doors: one straight ahead of him and the other to his right, which was twice the size of the first. Gingerly pulling the large door ajar, he discovered that it led to a lift. A metal cage was in readiness to propel the occupant downwards to who knew where. Reckless as he might have been to come this far, he certainly was not going to risk taking a ride in a lift, especially in Moriarty's domain.He tried the other door, which led to another short passage - almost an anteroom - and a further door. As soon as he began to open this, he heard voices. He stopped and peered through the crack that he had created. He gazed down upon a magnificent high chamber, wonderfully furnished and illuminated by electricity. As far as he could determine, the door was situated on a minstrel gallery above the chamber. The gallery ran round the four walls, made up of shelves which housed a vast quantity of books. Down below, two men were in quiet conversation. Crouching low, Holmes slipped through the door and laid on the floor, edging forward enough to survey the scene below him.From his vantage point, Holmes had an excellent view of the room and its occupants. He recognised one of the men straightaway. It was Colonel Sebastian Moran, Moriarty's second-in-command. Holmes observed the other man closely. He was a tall fellow, with finely chiselled, sardonic features and a hard cruel mouth and a mop of dark unruly hair. He had about him an air of power and authority. It was clear to Sherlock Holmes that this was Professor James Moriarty, the Napoleon of Crime. He was in his presence at last. A thrill of excitement rippled through his body. Here was his dark <i>doppelgï¿½nger</i>, a man as passionate about committing crime as Holmes was about solving it. Excitement transmuted to nervousness and uncertainty. It was as though he had only just realised the precariousness of his position. Oh, he had been clever to trace the devil to his lair, but he would have to be much cleverer to leave without being discovered. He pushed these thoughts from his mind; bridges to be crossed later. Moving even further to the edge of the gallery, he strained his ears to catch what the two men were saying.Moriarty leaned in a nonchalant fashion on the edge of the mantelpiece while Moran paced up and down in front of him.&#x201c;I'm not at all happy about Holmes's appearance tonight,&#x201d; Moran was saying.&#x201c;Neither am I,&#x201d; replied the Professor, in silky tones. &#x201c;But I will take steps to prevent his further involvement in my plans. We must utilise Watson again, and if that fails, I shall simply have to rid myself of this nuisance once and for all.&#x201d;&#x201c;Wouldn't it be possible to do that straightaway?&#x201d;&#x201c;Possibly, but my mind is filled with the Elephant's Egg operation at present, and I'd rather not be distracted by having to devise a suitable finale for Mr. Sherlock Holmes.&#x201d;Moran nodded. He knew better than to attempt to persuade his master otherwise.&#x201c;Everything is in place at the Indian end,&#x201d; continued Moriarty, as though he were speaking his thoughts aloud. &#x201c;Our man is ready to take the place of the Maharaja's envoy on the sea voyage. It is a substitution which has been worked out with the greatest precision. Reed is overseeing this. So when the ship docks in England, not only will the envoy be fake but the ruby also. No one will dare to examine it that closely. It would be most impolite to scrutinise such a gift. No one will realise that it is merely a very convincing piece of red glass. It will be presented to the Queen in a special ceremony at Windsor Castle, after which it will be lodged in the vaults there, with all the other trinkets she has acquired during her reign. It is unlikely that it will be seen again - or at least for some time. Meanwhile, we shall have the pleasure of profiting from this most bountiful of eggs.&#x201d; Moriarty allowed himself a brief smile.&#x201c;That's if Graves is prepared to co-operate.&#x201d;&#x201c;He will, Moran, he will. We have wasted too much time on these reluctant jewelers. He'll do as I ask... even if I have to use force.&#x201d;As though on cue, a door opened and Scoular entered, accompanied by a groggy-looking Patrick Graves. Scoular shepherded the jeweller to the sofa by the fire.&#x201c;Our man is coming round,&#x201d; he declared.Moriarty grinned. &#x201c;Good. Moran, be so kind as to give our visitor a reviving brandy.&#x201d;Moran did as he was ordered. Graves took the brandy glass and greedily downed the drink in one gulp, which brought on a coughing fit. The other three men waited patiently like statues until he had finished. &#x201c;Mr. Graves,&#x201d; said Moriarty, approaching the sofa, &#x201c;I have something for you, an offer that can make you a substantial amount of money or one that could result in you losing at least one of your limbs.&#x201d;Graves, who was already pale, blanched at the harshness of these words. &#x201c;Do I have a choice?&#x201d; he asked at length, in a halting fashion, his voice no more than a dry whisper.&#x201c;Indeed you do.&#x201d;Graves grinned slyly. &#x201c;Then I'd rather take the money option.&#x201d;Moriarty chuckled in a theatrical manner while his two companions gazed on Graves with stony stares. &#x201c;A man after my own heart.&#x201d;&#x201c;Any brandy perhaps?&#x201d; Graves held out his glass like a beggar.&#x201c;Give our friend another snifter, Moran, and Scoular, you see he gets a good night's rest. We can discuss details in the morning. I don't think we have any need to worry. I'm sure Mr. Graves will be as co-operative as we wish.&#x201d;&#x201c;Certainly will, gentlemen,&#x201d; agreed Graves, before taking another gulp of brandy from his refreshed glass.Sherlock Holmes, positioned high above this drama, concluded that he had learned as much as he needed for the time being, and that it would be prudent to make his escape. With infinite care he retraced his steps back through the two doors and along the panelled passage and up the wooden staircase. Below the trap-door, he paused and strained his ears for any noise, any sound of movement. He could hear none. He pushed up the trap-door sufficiently for him to survey the warehouse. It appeared as empty and deserted as when he had left it. His heart pounding with pleasure, he scrambled through.As soon as he was on his feet, he felt an arm grasp him around the neck. A gruff voice snarled in his ear. &#x201c;And what the hell do you think you're doing?&#x201d;Holmes swivelled his head to catch a glimpse of his assailant. It was the coach driver, back from his travels. With great speed and dexterity, Holmes grabbed the man's arms and, placing all his weight on his good leg, he heaved him over his shoulder. It was a practised Baritsu move. The man rose as though he were a rag doll, and landed with an unhealthy thud on his back some three feet away from the detective. He gave a cry of pain, and before he was able to lift himself from the ground, Holmes straddled his body and administered a powerful right hook to his chin. The driver's head fell backwards, his eyes tight shut and his mouth agape. Holmes could not help but smile with pleasure at his own strength and ability. He then carried out a search of the man's clothing until he found what he was looking for: the keys to the warehouse door. Within five minutes, Sherlock Holmes, limping badly now, was three streets away from Moriarty's warehouse. After half an hour, he was in a cab on his way back to Baker Street.</p><h2>Mathematics at Work: Practical Applications of Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, and Logarithms to the Step-By-Step Solutions of Mechanic</h2><p>Now &#34;Machinery&#39;s Handbook&#34; has a companion volume that will help readers solve specific mathematical problems that are related to mechanical work. &#34;Pocket-sized&#34;, this book presents practical applications of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and logarithms to the step-by-step solutions of mechanical problems, with formulas commonly used in engineering practice Pub: 3/90.</p><p></p><h2>How To Travel With A Salmon &amp; Other Essays (Harvest Book)</h2><p>In these &#x201c;impishly witty and ingeniously irreverent&#x201d; essays (Atlantic Monthly), &#x201c;the Andy Rooney of academia&#x201d; (Los Angeles Times) takes on computer jargon, librarians, bureaucrats, meals on airplanes, bad coffee, taxi drivers, 33-function watches, soccer fans, and more.

David Powell, for many years curator of the world-renowned Monterey Bay Aquarium, tells the story of his life as a pioneering aquarist. From handling great white sharks to transporting delicate fish on bumpy airplanes to night diving for fish in the Indian Ocean, <i>A Fascination for Fish </i>describes many of the mind-boggling challenges that make modern aquariums possible and offers an intriguing glimpse beneath the ocean's surface.<br><br>Powell's career in diving and aquarium development goes back to the beginning of modern methods in both areas. From the early techniques he devised to get fish into aquariums alive and healthy to his later exploratory dive to a depth of eleven hundred feet in a two-person submarine, Powell's action-packed narrative inspires laughter, wonder, and philosophical reflection. <i>A Fascination for Fish </i>also includes many stories about Powell's diving adventures on the California coast, in the Sea of Cortez, and in many remote and exotic locations around the world.</p><p>"This autobiography is a charming and accurate telling by a modest man whose brilliant career has allowed millions to venture into the sea and feel what Dave feels when he's underwater-without getting wet!"-John E. McCosker, Director Emeritus, Steinhart Aquarium, San Francisco <p>"Dave Powell is one of the giants in the development of the modern public aquarium. His great talents and skill have come from years of working with the technology of public aquariums, and also from a great love of the sea.

It is one of the longest-lived of verse forms, and one of the briefest. A mere fourteen lines, fashioned by intricate rhymes, it is, as Dante Gabriel Rossetti called it, &#x201c;a moment&#x2019;s monument.&#x201d; From the Renaissance to the present, the sonnet has given poets a superb vehicle for private contemplation, introspection, and the expression of passionate feelings and thoughts.</p><p><i>The Art of the Sonnet</i> collects one hundred exemplary sonnets of the English language (and a few sonnets in translation), representing highlights in the history of the sonnet, accompanied by short commentaries on each of the poems. The commentaries by Stephanie Burt and David Mikics offer new perspectives and insights, and, taken together, demonstrate the enduring as well as changing nature of the sonnet. The authors serve as guides to some of the most-celebrated sonnets in English as well as less-well-known gems by nineteenth- and twentieth-century poets. Also included is a general introductory essay, in which the authors examine the sonnet form and its long and fascinating history, from its origin in medieval Sicily to its English appropriation in the sixteenth century to sonnet writing today in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other English-speaking parts of the world.</p></p><p><p>Stephanie Burt is Professor of English at Harvard University.</p><p>David Mikics is John and Rebecca Moores Professor of English at the University of Houston.</p>&#x201c;Burt and Mikics have a ravishing breadth of taste and understanding. Their capaciousness allows the sonnet greater variety than its enemies (who think it old-fashioned, retrograde, and reactionary) would allow. A literary <i>tour de force</i>.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Willard Spiegelman, author of <i>Seven Pleasures: Essays on Ordinary Happiness</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Burt and Mikics have gathered together and composed a marvelous book.

I know of no other recent book that so steadily illuminates the riches it invokes.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Harold Bloom</b><br><br>&#x201c;Burt and Mikics have written an illuminating text that promises many hours of reading pleasure and greater understanding of this poetic form.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Susan L.

[The editors&#x2019;] aim is to present &#x2018;a partial history of the sonnet form.&#x2019; But that puts it too modestly. With their selection of poems and their (mostly) compelling essays, Burt and Mikics manage to give a vivid sense of the sonnet in English as a living, organic thing, interconnected and evolving through time... It&#x2019;s the essays that really distinguish this volume... Many of these essays are models of how to write about a poem, especially one centuries old. If you like to get under the hood of a poem and poke around at its inner mechanics, to see what makes it go, then the more technical parts of these essays won&#x2019;t disappoint. But they&#x2019;re not just technical: They strike an appealing balance of historical, biographical, and textual analysis, while remaining, for the most part, accessible.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Wen Stephenson</b><b>, </b><b><i>Boston Globe</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Newcomers to poetry and longtime readers alike will find this a rich and rewarding volume.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Lauren Winner</b><b>, </b><b><i>Books &amp; Culture</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[A] handsome collection of 100 sonnets...It is to the credit of the compilers of this fine anthology that they manage to mount persuasive (and mercifully jargon-free) arguments that even poems as idiosyncratic as [Les Murray's] "Strangler Fig" reflect the venerable and seemingly inexhaustible traditions of the sonnet.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Andrew Riemer</b><b>, </b><b><i>Sydney Morning Herald</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The editors...[have] collected one hundred enjoyable sonnets reaching back to Thomas Wyatt and George Gascoigne, and meanwhile, providing a thorough introduction and thoroughly astute commentary on each sonnet.

And, of the many writers who have attempted this kind of thing since Buchan, only a very few, like Graham Greene, have managed to sustain the tension in the same way. The main character is Buchan&#39;s familiar hero, Richard Hannay who gets caught up quite suddenly on a dull London afternoon in a situation of extreme danger. Before he knows what is happening he is the obvious suspect for a murder committed in his own flat, and has to go on the run to his native Scotland.</p><p>In this classic tale of wartime espionage, Richard Hannay's living nightmare begins with the discovery of a dead man and a notebook with thirty-nine steps to uncover. David Robb stars as Hannay and Doctor Who&#x2019;s Tom Baker plays his ally Sir Walter Bullivant, in this recording which pays homage to the classic Hitchcock film.John Buchan wrote The Thirty-Nine Steps while he was seriously ill at the beginning of the First World War. In it he introduces his most famous hero, Richard Hannay, who, despite claiming to be an &#39;ordinary fellow&#39;, is caught up in the dramatic race against a plot to devastate the British war effort.</p><h2>George Mï¿½ller on Faith (30-Day Devotional Treasury)</h2><p>This 30-day Devotional Treasury is a powerful encounter with a legendary spiritual leader whose life and words profoundly impacted the church and the world.

His life and writings challenge readers to see that the puny supplies of man are dwarfed beside the reservoirs of God's grace that can be tapped by faith.</p><p></p><h2>Developing Helping Skills: A Step-by-Step Approach to Competency (HSE 123 Interviewing Techniques)</h2><p>Whether you are preparing for social work, psychology, counseling, marriage and family therapy, pastoral counseling, human services, or a related helping profession, this unique book offers the fundamental knowledge and skills sets you need.

In this masterful book, Thomas Knock traces George McGovern's life from his rustic boyhood in a South Dakota prairie town during the Depression to his rise to the pinnacle of politics at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago where police and antiwar demonstrators clashed in the city's streets.</p><p>Drawing extensively on McGovern's private papers and scores of in-depth interviews, Knock shows how McGovern's importance to the Democratic Party and American liberalism extended far beyond his 1972 presidential campaign, and how the story of postwar American politics is about more than just the rise of the New Right. He vividly describes McGovern's harrowing missions over Nazi Germany as a B-24 bomber pilot, and reveals how McGovern's combat experiences motivated him to earn a PhD in history and stoked his ambition to run for Congress. When President Kennedy appointed him director of Food for Peace in 1961, McGovern engineered a vast expansion of the program's school lunch initiative that soon was feeding tens of millions of hungry children around the world.

His attention to detail, his insistence on the finest materials, and his use of elements of fantasy and opulence together create a subtle balance between the different parts of a Molyneux room or the pieces within it, inspiring a sense of calm.<br><br>This volume, the first devoted to the New York-based designer's work, presents more than a dozen of his most recent projects, from a Beaux Arts mansion in the heart of Buenos Aires to a Park Avenue penthouse. Superb color photographs illustrate these varied homes, providing a personally guided tour replete with insights into Molyneux's structural strategies and furniture selections. Highlighted are features of ornamentation, geometric floor patterns, and trompe l'oeil, the latter regarded by Molyneux as "a fantasy that provokes reality." Born and educated in Chile, Molyneux also studied classical architecture and Egyptology in Paris. He is at ease with different centuries and cultures, an important asset in this era of global eclecticism. Yet his unique mix of disparate objects-- the eighteenth-century French armchairs, seventeenth-century Florentine tables, and paintings by Picasso and Bacon in the living room of a Palm Beach house being but one example-- is based upon inherent and carefully considered correspondences between them.<br><br>While the residences seen here are clearly the properties of an exclusive clientele, Molyneux's fresh, direct, and pragmatic voice turns them into an essential source of inspiration for aspiring home decorators and professional designers. Through author Michael Frank's specific histories of these dramatic interiors-- including Molyneux's own-- and complementary drawings, photographs, and details,<i> MOLYNEUX</i> is the tale of a true love of design.<br></p><p><b>Juan Pablo Molyneux </b>was born in Chile and studied architecture at the Catholic University of Santiago and at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris.

He met with a hero&#x2019;s welcome. In the weeks that followed, well-wishers and admirers regularly approached him in the streets, among them a Scottish-born woman who cornered him in a shop on Broadway. Drawing before her a six-year-old child, she exclaimed, &#x201c;Please, Your Excellency, here&#x2019;s a bairn that&#x2019;s called after ye.&#x201d; It was Washington Irving. In retrospect, the scene seemed prophetic. Later in life, after having established a reputation as the first American man of letters, Irving recalled in an interview how Washington &#x201c;laid his hand upon my head, and gave me his blessing.&#x201d; Three generations after the Revolutionary War, George Washington was revered as the father of our country. Irving likewise was recognized as a founding father of America&#x2019;s national literature.</p><p>Such a title might strike today&#x2019;s reader as an exaggeration. Irving&#x2019;s best-known characters, Rip Van Winkle and Ichabod Crane, do not seem substantial enough to serve as foundational figures in an American literary tradition. However, the stories Irving set in Sleepy Hollow, a secluded village in the Hudson River Valley, provided American culture with a local habitation and a name. Along with James Fenimore Cooper and William Cullen Bryant, Irving was one of America&#x2019;s pioneer writers. He helped sketch the contours of a cultural landscape that was unique to the United States, not a pale imitation of the literature of England and Europe. Sleepy Hollow is an early example of American authors self-consciously setting out to create an imaginative space for artistic creativity. Nathaniel Hawthorne described this sort of space in his introduction to <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> as &#x201c;a neutral territory, somewhere between the real-world and fairy-land, where the Actual and the Imaginary may meet, and each imbue itself with the nature of the other.&#x201d; By providing such a &#x201c;neutral territory&#x201d; for his readers, Irving contributed to the new nation&#x2019;s efforts to generate a collective cultural memory from native sources.</p></p><h2>THREE CLASSIC VOLUMES FROM THE CRIME FILES OF ANNE RULE: A Rose for Her Grave/You Belong to Me/Fever in the Heart</h2><p>A treasury of three best-sellers by the popular true-crime author collects the cases of marry-for-profit killer Randy Roth, obsessed state trooper Tim Harris, and an explosive midwestern love triangle.</p><p></p><h2>Fiasco</h2><p>&#39;There were two kinds of landscape characteristic of the inner planets of the Sun: the purposeful and the desolate.&#39; The planet Quinta is pocked with ugly mounds and covered by a spiderweb-like network draped from spindly poles.

His very presence should produce a foundational transformation in the life of the one who has met with Him. It is not enough for us to talk about what we have experienced. We should be living it out flamboyantly. This is what He expects of us. He has said in His Word, "Come out from them and be separate" (2 Corinthians 6:17). This is His call to us-to be changed as a result of our meetings with Him. But what does that change look like? There should be some tangible, genuine evidence of a transformation. And when you and I encounter Jesus and recognize His hand moving in our lives, we should experience this radical change.<br></p><h2>The need for roots: Prelude to a declaration of duties towards mankind</h2><p>Simone Weil deals with the needs of the soul, discussing order, liberty, obedience, responsibility and many other subjects, finishing with the need for truth.</p><p><strong>Simone Weil</strong> (1909-1943).

In How to Make Collaboration Work, David Straus, a pioneer in the field of group problem solving, introduces five principles of collaboration that have been proven successful time and again in nearly every conceivable setting.<br> Straus draws on his thirty years of personal and professional experience to show how these principles have been applied by organizations as diverse as Ford Motor Company, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Harvard Business School Publishing, Boston Public Schools, Kaiser Permanente, the city of Denver, and many others.<br> How to Make Collaboration Work shows how collaboration can become a joy rather than a chore-a kind of chemical reaction that releases far more energy than it consumes.</p><p>David Straus founded Interaction Associates in 1969. Over the years, he has served in every major leadership position in the company, including president, CEO, and chairman of the board. Under his guidance, Interaction Associates has become a recognized leader in organizational development, group process facilitation, training, and consulting.<br> Mr. Straus guided the development of Interaction Associates&#x2019; consulting practice and training programs. He was also responsible for major change efforts in a variety of organizations, including the health care and service industries. He has worked with social action partnerships in Newark, New Jersey, and Palm Beach County, Florida, as well.<br> Mr. Straus earned a Bachelor&#x2019;s degree from Harvard University and a Master&#x2019;s degree in architecture from Harvard&#x2019;s Graduate School of Design. With grants from the National Institute of Mental Health and the Carnegie Corporation, he conducted re- search in creativity and developed training programs in problem solving. Mr. Straus also coauthored the bestseller How to Make Meetings Work (Jove Books, 1976).<br> David Straus lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with his wife, Patricia. They have two daughters, Sara Landis and Rebecca Straus.The Power of Collaborative Action<br><br> People in nearly every occupation and every walk of life have to work and make decisions collaboratively. Collaboration is required at every level of every organization&#x2014;be it a corporation, small business, nonprofit organization, educational institution, government agency, or legislative body. And collaboration takes place not only within these organizations, but also between and among them. Collaborative action is required, for example, when:<br> a senior management team needs to figure out how to cut expenses by 15 percent;<br> an organization wants to define its purpose and vision, or develop a strategic plan;<br> a team in an advertising agency needs to design a new ad campaign;<br> administrative staffers have to make logistical arrangements for an important company retreat;<br> a group of teachers must jointly develop a new curriculum;<br> nonprofit advocacy groups want to form a coalition to lobby for a particular issue;2<br> a number of social service agencies must determine how to coordinate their services;<br> a government agency needs to update its policy for regulating a toxic pollutant;<br> or a couple decides they want to build a new house.<br> The list could go on and on. These and so many other activities require collaboration. They require people to work together to plan, solve problems, and/or make decisions before action can be taken.<br><br> You undoubtedly collaborate all the time&#x2014;primarily at work, but also at home, in your volunteer activities, at your child&#x2019;s school. You may not think of what you are doing as collaboration, but if you have to get the support and agreement of others before you can take action of some kind, then you are collaborating.<br><br> Even in those cases in which you supposedly have the power to act unilaterally&#x2014;in which you can simply make a decision and then act on it&#x2014;you probably know that you still have to work collaboratively. Perhaps you need to collaborate because, for example, too many people have the power to block the implementation of your decision or solution. Perhaps power has become spread out (or lateralized). Or, the potential costs of acting unilaterally may be too high. You could force a decision, but you would meet with so much resistance and create so much ill will that you would erode your base of support. Perhaps your colleagues, employees, or constituents simply expect or demand that you act more inclusively and collaboratively. Or, maybe you don&#x2019;t have the skills or knowledge to make the decision or solve the problem by yourself. You may need to include and cooperate with others in order to make the best decision possible.<br><br> Whatever the situation, it&#x2019;s quite clear that we all have to work collaboratively with others.<br><br> But let&#x2019;s face it, our experience in trying to reach agreement with others is often unpleasant. We don&#x2019;t enjoy it at all. It&#x2019;s hard. Our 3 efforts often seem ineffective. Collaboration typically involves meetings, and no one likes meetings. We make jokes about how &#x201c;a camel is a horse designed by a committee.&#x201d; We are cynical when we hear that a politician has appointed a fifty-person &#x201c;blue-ribbon panel&#x201d; to develop consensus recommendations, because we assume either that it&#x2019;s a stalling tactic or that the panel is stacked with people who share the politician&#x2019;s point of view. After all, how could fifty people with diverging opinions possibly reach consensus?<br><br> The problems that can arise in a meeting in which collaboration is supposed to take place are numerous and familiar. People may talk over each other or interrupt each other. Certain individuals&#x2014;by virtue of their positions or their personalities&#x2014;may dominate or manipulate the conversation. Participants may be unable to stay focused on one topic at a time. The conversation may veer all over the place, causing people to become exasperated. Perhaps there&#x2019;s no clear picture of what the group&#x2019;s goal is, or how the group is going to get there. Or participants may realize, midway through a discussion, that some key people are missing&#x2014;that whatever they decide could be &#x201c;shot down&#x201d; by someone outside the process. These examples of meeting problems are magnified when a collaborative effort involves large numbers of people and multiple meetings over time.<br><br> The fact is, however, there&#x2019;s nothing inherently unpleasant about collaboration. Working together to solve a problem, envision a future, or make a decision can actually be an enjoyable and even energizing experience.<br><br> I don&#x2019;t make that statement lightly. I base it on thirty years of trial-and-error experience in the field of collaborative problem solving.<br><br> My colleagues and clients and I have proven, time and time again, that collaborative action can be a powerful experience. A well-managed collaborative effort is like a chemical reaction that creates far more energy than it consumes. It makes you feel energized, not drained. We call this phenomenon the Interaction Effect. When a group is in alignment about its direction (where it is 4 trying to go), its commitment (the will it possesses to get there), and its capability (the skills and knowledge it has to complete its journey), there is a release of energy. Not only are team members energized by the process, but so is the surrounding organization or community. It&#x2019;s this energy that fuels an extended collaborative effort and keeps it going during rough times.<br><br> Even more important, collaboration works. If you understand how problem solving works and adhere to a few basic principles, it is possible to make decisions and develop solutions that everyone can support. Through collaborative action, you can produce higher-quality ideas and solutions than you can if you work by yourself. People who are affected by a potential decision, have relevant information and skills, or have the power to block a decision are more likely to support that decision if they have had a hand in making it.<br><br> Furthermore, I believe that stakeholder voice is a basic right of individuals in healthy workplaces and democratic societies. Collaborative action is a natural outgrowth of this right and a demonstration of respect for human dignity.<br><br> So, why is it that this potentially energizing experience is so unpleasant for so many people?<br><br> In short, because most people don&#x2019;t know how to collaborate effectively. Collaboration needs to be learned. It&#x2019;s an art, really, that is based on a few powerful principles. But most people aren&#x2019;t familiar with those principles. They&#x2019;ve never been taught them.<br><br> Think back to your early education. If it was anything like mine, you were taught in school to value and strive for individual success. You studied, took tests, gave presentations, and were graded and given awards individually. Group work was neither measured nor rewarded. Team sports may have provided some antidote to all of this &#x201c;I&#x201d; focus, but, even there, weren&#x2019;t you mostly encouraged to develop individual prowess for the sake of the team? That&#x2019;s not the same as solving problems or making decisions collaboratively, which is what&#x2019;s demanded of us in today&#x2019;s workplaces and communities. 5<br><br> Another reason we don&#x2019;t know how to collaborate is that our schools focused (and still do focus) on teaching us content, not process. In school, we were taught what to learn&#x2014;what facts and formulas to memorize&#x2014;but we were rarely taught how to learn. Likewise, we were given problems to work out, and we were eventually given the answers to those problems, but we were seldom taught explicitly how to solve the problems&#x2014;what mental or physical processes to use. And since we didn&#x2019;t learn how to solve problems individually, it&#x2019;s no wonder we have trouble solving problems collaboratively.<br><br> In this book, therefore, I hope to help fill this gap in our educational background. I hope to help you learn about the process of collaborative problem solving. And I hope to demystify the process and show you that it really isn&#x2019;t hard or unpleasant. It really can be enjoyable and energizing!<br> What Collaboration IS<br><br> When I use the synonymous terms collaboration, collaborative action, and collaborative problem solving, I am referring to the process people employ when working together in a group, organization, or community to plan, create, solve problems, and make decisions.<br><br> Clearly, I&#x2019;m not using the word collaboration in its negative sense, as in collaborating or working with the enemy. I have done enough work in Europe and former Communist countries to know that collaboration often viscerally evokes an image of collusion. In those situations, I have found that the word cooperation has more of the intended meaning of working toward a positive outcome together. Also, using the term collaborative action sometimes helps to avoid this pitfall.<br><br> Then there are the words problem and problem solving. As I will discuss in Chapter 2, I use these words in their most general and inclusive sense. I define a problem as &#x201c;a situation someone wants to change.&#x201d; Problem solving, then, is simply situation changing. It 6 encompasses decision making and planning and all kinds of creative activities such as designing, exploring new opportunities, engaging in appreciative inquiry, visioning, learning, and communicating.<br><br> Problem solving, and specifically collaborative problem solving, is a process that is largely independent of content. The distinction between process and content is very important for the message of this book. I once asked a class of sixth graders for definitions of these two words. One boy raised his hand and said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just like chewing gum. Chewing is my process. Gum is my content. I can chew all sorts of things. Gum is what I happen to be chewing now.&#x201d; He was exactly right. Process is the how (chewing), content is the what (gum).<br><br> This book is about the process of collaborative problem solving. The process is content-independent. It can be applied to any kind of issue, subject matter, or opportunity. If you become aware of this process and grasp the principles in this book, you will be able to harness the power of collaborative action in almost any situation.<br> How This Book Is Organized<br><br> I hope to inspire and empower you to collaborate successfully with others in your personal and professional lives. Toward this end, I have organized the book into three parts.<br><br> Part I deals with the important meta-idea of human problem solving. While the focus of this book is more on collaboration than on problem solving, per se, it&#x2019;s important to understand some basic facts about the trial-and-error nature of human problem solving in order to understand how humans can solve problems together. If you are confronted by an immediate collaboration-related problem, you may want to jump to the most relevant chapter in Part II. However, I urge you to return to Part I in order to build a base of understanding for the ideas that follow. 7<br><br> Guided by my experience with the Eastern European trainers who wanted &#x201c;a few powerful ideas,&#x201d; in Part II I have tried to distill what I know into five principles of collaborative problem solving. Each principle speaks to both our hearts and minds. Each principle can also be applied to any scale of collaborative problem solving, from interpersonal and small-group processes to organization- and community-wide processes. Taken together, the five principles offer an actionable paradigm, a way of looking at the world that is hopeful. What has been so exciting for me to witness is that these principles simply work. They have been applied successfully in hundreds of organizations and communities both in the United States and around the world.<br><br> Each principle addresses the specific questions and challenges you are likely to confront when trying to design and manage a process of collaboration. These include:<br> With whom do I need to collaborate? Do I really have to involve people who oppose my ideas?<br> What if there are many people involved&#x2014;many organizations, departments, or organizations? How would we ever get them together? How would the process work?<br> If we actually get everyone in the same room together, who will run the meeting and how?<br> How do we keep the group from spinning its wheels or getting bogged down?<br> What if we are spread out geographically all over the country or world?<br> How do we make decisions? What happens if we can&#x2019;t easily come to agreement? Do we vote?<br> The following is a preview of the five principles:<br> Involve the Relevant Stakeholders. One of the biggest mistakes people make in trying to work collaboratively is to 8 exclude a key individual or interest group. &#x201c;We weren&#x2019;t consulted,&#x201d; is an oft-heard complaint that prevents collaborative work from succeeding. So, you need to determine who the stakeholders are and how to involve them. In general, the power of collaborative action comes from inclusion, not exclusion. It&#x2019;s far more powerful to have someone inside the tent than outside. The long-term payoff is immeasurable.<br> Build Consensus Phase by Phase. Consensus has been reached when everyone agrees to support a decision. And agreement doesn&#x2019;t just happen; it has to be built, phase by phase. Working face-to-face to build agreements is significantly different from negotiating through a mediator. And consensus building always needs a fallback decision-making process&#x2014;some way of coming to a decision if consensus can&#x2019;t be reached.<br> Design a Process Map. People become anxious in the face of too much uncertainty. Before agreeing to collaborate, they will probably want some sense of what they&#x2019;re getting into. What is needed is a clear means of designing and managing an open-ended process of collaboration. The most powerful way to do this is to create a process map&#x2014;a visual representation of a collaborative process. The process map serves the same function for a long-term collaborative process that an agenda does for a single meeting. It defines the order of activities and gives participants a sense of how these activities fit into the larger context.<br> Designate a Process Facilitator. Not surprisingly, much of the business of collaboration takes place when people come together to talk. And, time and time again, we see and hear about leaders trying to run their own meetings. This is often a mistake! As a leader, it&#x2019;s difficult for you to be neutral about how a meeting is run when you care deeply about and are accountable for the decisions made in that meeting. It&#x2019;s9 essential that you separate process leadership from content leadership and create a new role, that of facilitator. A facilitator is a neutral process guide and servant to the group.<br> Harness the Power of Group Memory. Data overload, repetition, wheel-spinning, and lack of focus are all symptoms of bad meetings. And they all have the same solution: chart pads and colored markers. If you rearrange the seats in a semicircle, tape sheets of newsprint on the wall, and have someone serve as a recorder, these common meeting problems will be prevented. The record, or group memory, that is created in front of the group is one of the most simple&#x2014;and powerful&#x2014;tools of collaboration.<br> Part III of the book looks to the future, exploring what happens if you apply these principles of collaboration throughout a whole organization or community. How would your role as a leader have to change? How can you create a culture of collaboration in an entire corporation or community, and what is the effect if you do? I cover some of the evidence that suggests that collaborative organizations and collaborative communities function better and are healthier places in which to work and live than their more traditional, command-and-control counterparts. I also offer some thoughts on how and where you might begin to put these powerful ideas about collabor...</p><h2>Critical Theory Since Plato</h2><p>CRITICAL THEORY SINCE PLATO is a chronologically-arranged anthology that presents a broad survey of the history and development of literary criticism and theory in Western culture.

Methodically, but with a sometimes uncanny visual sensitivity, Hills (Warwick Univ., England) reconstructs the range and nuance of the Venetian palette as it manifests itself in the specific materials employed in the city&#39;s architectural and urban fabric, mosaics, minor arts, textiles, and painting. The evolving and expanding range of coloristic decisions and innovations that culminate in the masterpieces of Bellini, Giorgione, and Titian are savored within the unique effects of Venice&#39;s ambiance.

The series provides students, primarily though not exclusively those of English literature, with the opportunity of reading significant prose writers who, for a variety of reasons (not least their generally being unavailable in suitable editions), are rarely studied, but whose influence on their times was very considerable. Marilyn Butler&#39;s volume centres on the great Revolution debate in England in the 1790s, inspired by the French Revolution. The debate consists of a single series of works which depend for their meaning upon one another, and upon the historical situation which gave them birth. Major tracts by Burke (Reflections on the Revolution in France), Paine (The Rights of Man), and Godwin (Enquiry Concerning Political Justice) are given at length, while important shorter pieces by such writers as Hannah More, Thomas Spence, and William Cobbett appear virtually complete. The volume is especially interesting for its portrait of a community of oppositional writers. Many of them knew one another personally, and stimulated and sustained one another against the pro-government majority. Their collaborative literary enterprise, and its break up, offer a fascinating perspective on Romanticism and the growth of an extra-parliamentary opposition functioning through the press. The volume also reveals the impact of the great debate on writers such as Mary Wollstonecraft, Coleridge, and Wordsworth. As with other titles in the series, the volume is comprehensively annotated: obscure allusions to people, places, and events are glossed in footnotes and endnotes, while prefactory headnotes comment on the circumstances surrounding the composition of each extract. In a substantial introduction Dr Butler offers a broad examination of this pamphlet war and its main participants. There is a helpful critical guide to further reading for those wishing to pursue their study of the subject. The volume will be a vital sourcebook for students of English Romantic literature, history, and political history.</p><p>Analysis of the great Revolution debate of late eighteenth century England, inspired by the French Revolution, reveals how the passions of oppositional writers were sufficiently aroused to create a &#34;pamphlet war.&#34;</p><h2>Student Solutions Manual to accompany Calculus: Ideas and Applications, 1e</h2><p><p><strong>The smart student's secret to study success</strong> </p><p>The <em>Student Solutions Manual to accompany Calculus: Ideas and Applications</em> helps students ensure their own success.

Gaining a true understanding of the Resistance means recognizing how its image has been carefully curated through a combination of French politics and pride, ever since jubilant crowds celebrated Paris&#x2019;s liberation in August 1944. Robert Gildea&#x2019;s penetrating history of resistance in France during World War II sweeps aside &#x201c;the French Resistance&#x201d; of a thousand clichï¿½s, showing that much more was at stake than freeing a single nation from Nazi tyranny.</p><p>As <i>Fighters in the Shadows </i>makes clear, French resistance was part of a Europe-wide struggle against fascism, carried out by an extraordinarily diverse group: not only French men and women but Spanish Republicans, Italian anti-fascists, French and foreign Jews, British and American agents, and even German opponents of Hitler. In France, resistance skirted the edge of civil war between right and left, pitting non-communists who wanted to drive out the Germans and eliminate the Vichy regime while avoiding social revolution at all costs against communist advocates of national insurrection. In French colonial Africa and the Near East, battle was joined between de Gaulle&#x2019;s Free French and forces loyal to Vichy before they combined to liberate France.</p><p>Based on a riveting reading of diaries, memoirs, letters, and interviews of contemporaries, <i>Fighters in the Shadows</i> gives authentic voice to the resisters themselves, revealing the diversity of their struggles for freedom in the darkest hours of occupation and collaboration.</p></p><p>Robert Gildea is Professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford.With its deep concern for human failings, and for the suffering that came from bravery that was badly channeled or poorly rewarded, Gildea&#x2019;s book might have been dark and pessimistic. In fact it is vivid with real life and ordinary heroism. In this, what is an apparently straightforward aim&#x2015;that Gildea felt it was high time to give resistance fighters their voice in the story&#x2015;is in fact deeply important... The relentless, persistent way in which Gildea gives voice to a kaleidoscope of men and women of different nationalities and races does more than any author before him to provide a convincingly complex and moving account of the ways in which people in France took up arms against the Vichy state and the Nazi occupation. This book cuts against the grain of classic narratives, not by setting out counter-narratives but by asking for our attention, for a page or two at a time, to listen to detail: the real-life detail of the frustrations, the suffering and heroism of people who exist at several removes from the grand shapers of history. (Julian Wright <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>An important new book...[Gildea] blends top-down history with the bottom-up stories of those who schemed, improvised, grabbed chances and risked their lives. (<i>The Economist</i>)<br><br>[An] ambitious overview of the Vichy years...There have been many excellent recent books, both in French and in English...on France during the resistance years. What Gildea has done is to step back and look at the wider picture, thereby providing a context for the individual acts of courage, which he celebrates in moving detail. He gives recognition to the widest range of participants, many of them little known, and to the categories who did not fit well into the postwar myth of heroism, and that is perhaps his most important contribution to the field. (Caroline Moorhead <i>The Guardian</i>)<br><br>Deeply researched [and] sophisticated...The picture of the Resistance movement to emerge in Gildea&#x2019;s account is far, far more complicated and morally ambiguous than the myth would suggest...Gildea is at his best in conveying a richly textured picture of the Resistance as diverse in makeup, motivation, and strategy...Gildea&#x2019;s masterly account of the liberation of Paris, and of de Gaulle&#x2019;s crafty work in outmaneuvering the Communist effort to spark a people&#x2019;s uprising, is one of the highlights of this fine contribution to our understanding of World War II&#x2019;s most important resistance movement. (James A. Warren <i>Daily Beast</i>)<br><br>Scrupulous, evenhanded reconsideration of the fighters of the French Resistance and how the patriotic myth became central to the identity of postwar France. Employing a refreshing approach to the history of this traumatic epoch by sticking with firsthand testimony, both written and oral, Gildea restores some of the marginalized voices so crucial to the story: women, communists, and foreigners...Gildea proceeds step by step in the buildup to resistance, which required both an internal and external network, especially from de Gaulle&#x2019;s Allied base in London. Moreover, the liberation by the Americans of North Africa in November 1942 proved to be the &#x2018;hinge&#x2019; in galvanizing resistance and clarifying the Vichy versus Free French struggle. A masterly, painstakingly researched study incorporating the urgent stories of the resisters themselves. (<i>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</i>)<br><br>This book is a must-read. It paints on a broad canvas the story of the men and the women, French and foreign, who fought and fell in the ranks of the French Resistance, following the interior resistance and the Free French, political movements, Allied intelligence networks and the maquis. Gildea confronts the dissensions that divided the Resistance and evokes the many and complex emotions experienced by its fighters. He has accomplished a tour de force. (Guillaume Piketty, Professor of History, Sciences Po, Paris)<br><br>Gildea is among the best historians writing today about French identity, and specifically about how France&#x2019;s national myths have been re-formed over the past 75 years...His compellingly detailed&#x2015;and lengthy&#x2015;book brings forth the testimonies of many <i>rï¿½sistants </i>and <i>rï¿½sistantes </i>that have been gathering dust in archives, in museums, in forgotten memoirs and in the memories of still living actors in the drama. He has done a daunting amount of research, ranging from an almost archaeological fascination with the layers of myth surrounding the meaning of &#x2018;resistance&#x2019; to compassionate interviews with survivors and their descendants. <i>Fighters in the Shadows</i> gives us a cacophony of voices, subtly orchestrated by a historian who loves France, yet one who respects historical objectivity...Gildea is meticulous in his analysis of how the French have remembered this fateful half-decade in their history. In the final chapters, he deftly leads us through the minefield of postwar collective memory. (Ronald C.

Moving from within the fold to beyond the pale, Mosley switched from the Conservative party to Labour in protest against governmental brutality in Ireland, and then, in contempt of Labour's broken campaign promises, founded the British Union of Fascists. Although still moving in aristocratic circles, Mosley's fascist activities finally led to his imprisonment in 1940.<br>Throughout his stormy career Mosley preserved his taste for the elegant pursuits of a country gentleman: his warm correspondence with his son shows his interest in philosophy and literature. It was perhaps because he managed to embrace so many opposites at once that he appeared in old age so serene, and that he continues to fascinate us.<br>Finally, this is also the autobiography of his son, distinguished novelist Nicholas Mosley, and his movement from worshipful adulation, to estrangement, to reconciliation and understanding of his remarkable father.</p><p>Born in London, Mosley was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford and served in Italy during the Second World War, winning the Military Cross for bravery. He succeeded as 3rd Baron Ravensdale in 1966 and, on the death of his father on 3 December 1980, he also succeeded to the Baronetcy. His father, Sir Oswald Mosley, founded the British Union of Fascists in 1932 and was a supporter of Benito Mussolini. Sir Oswald was arrested in 1940 for his antiwar campaigning, and spent the majority of World War II in prison. As an adult, Nicholas was a harsh critic of his father in &#34;Beyond the Pale: Sir Oswald Mosley and Family 1933-1980&#34; (1983), calling into question his father&#39;s motives and understanding of politics. Nicholas&#39; work contributed to the 1998 Channel 4 television programme titled &#39;Mosley&#39; based on his father&#39;s life. At the end of the mini-series, Nicholas is portrayed meeting his father in prison to ask him about his national allegiance. Mosley began to stammer as a young boy, and attended weekly sessions with speech therapist Lionel Logue in order to help him overcome the speech disorder. Mosley says his father claimed never really to have noticed his stammer, but feels Sir Oswald may have been less aggressive when speaking to him than he was towards other people as a result.A memoir of the late British Fascist leader by his novelist son Nicholas Mosley (Judith, 1990, Serpent, 1989, etc.) may seem problematic, but as a biography of a controversial father by a loving and cleareyed son it is surprisingly charming. The Mosleys, it seems, were a very rum lot. Both Sir Oswald's father and grandfather lived apart from their wives, supposedly, in the case of his father, because of the man's insatiable and promiscuous sexual habits. Though Sir Oswald's own marriage to the daughter of Lord Curzon, the British foreign secretary, seems to have been a loving one, it was characterized by constant infidelities; Sir Oswald seems to have made love not only to most of his wife's friends but to her sister and her stepmother as well. He entered Parliament as a Conservative at age 22, became an Independent, then a Labor candidate, and was appointed to Ramsay MacDonald's cabinet in his 30's. He was regarded as one of the finest orators in the House of Commons, and as a possible future prime minister. But this was during the Depression, and Sir Oswald, to the left of the Labor Party, seems to have been appalled at the failure of Labor to honor its promises. It was at this point that he--perhaps influenced by his extraordinary impact on crowds and by the burgeoning of Fascism in Europe--seems to have gone wrong, and to have lacked the ordinary prudence to correct his mistake. The result was a fiasco, a dwindling following, and three years of imprisonment without trial at the start of WW II, followed by two years under house arrest. This is the inheritance with which the son seeks to grapple, and it is a tribute to his honesty and insight--as well as to the rakish recklessness and demonic ability of his subject--that it's hard to resist a measure of sympathy for one who has hitherto been regarded as beyond the pale. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This was the first and last period before the Romans in which great political and military power was located in the same place as cultural importance. This volume, therefore, is more narrowly focused geographically than its predecessors and successors, and hardly strays beyond Greece. Athens is at the center of the picture, both politically and culturally, but events and achievements elsewhere are assessed as carefully as the nature of our sources allows. Two series of narrative chapters, one on the growth of the Athenian empire and the development of Athenian democracy, the other on the Peloponnesian War that brought them down, are divided by a series of studies in which the artistic and literary achievements of the fifth century are described.</p><p>The fifth century BC was not only the first Classic age of European civilisation.

Additionally, the text covers the four skills (speaking, writing, listening comprehension, and reading) and culture in an integrated way. I consider Teacher&#39;s Handbook to be a foundational text for students; a text that provides a theoretical and practical foundation upon which language teachers (present and future) will continue to build through research, teaching experience, and self-reflection and analysis.

There is a strong rhythmto the thoughts, the arguments, and the entire sequence of essayspresented here."<br> <br> --American Journal of Education</p><p>It is imagination, says Maxine Greene, that opens our eyes to worlds beyond our experience--enabling us to create, care for others, and envision social change. In Releasing the Imagination, this renowned educator and philosopher reveals the critical role of imagination in cognitive and other modes of learning.Ruminating on themes such as literacy, the arts and aesthetics, pluralism, multiculturalism, and the tensions and passions of caring, Greene carefully considers both the realities of hard economic times and the human requirement for expressiveness. She shows that, while today&#39;s economic realities require an inevitable emphasis on vocational and technical training, this focus must be counterbalanced by an emphasis on the release of the human imagination and the cultivation of new visions. Greene explains how the arts play a key role in building understanding across differences and in stimulating the capacity to break with the habitual and the taken-for-granted--counteracting the sometimes pervasive sense of futility that overwhelms many of our youth.From an account of school restructuring to a rendering of the shapes of literacy, Greene&#39;s essays examine the potential releases of imagination in a variety of contexts--in connection with the arts, and in connection with the community that, she hopes, &#34;will some day be called democracy.&#34;&#34;Releasing the Imagination gives us a vivid portrait of the possibilities of human experience and education&#39;s role in its realization.

As in her seminal book <i>The Ballad of Sexual Dependency</i>, the subjects of <i>Ten Years After</i> are Goldin's friends and she is expert at conveying the emotional charge she seems to feel around them. The photographs depict them at home in and around Naples, Italy, in 1986 and again in 1996. Cookie, Vittorio, and Daniele--to whose memory the book is dedicated--figure heavily in the earlier pictures. The images are of everyday life: the three friends walking a dog in the woods, Cookie alone in the bathtub, Cookie and Daniele casually posing as if for a quick snapshot. But Goldin's lens transforms these shots into sublime images. Cookie's bath is so drenched in yellow sunlight that viewers feel there's a chance they're peering into heaven. Rebecca at the beach holding an infant to her breast, with a towel draped over her head as a sun shield, is as lovely and intense as any depiction of the Madonna and child. When Goldin returns to Naples 10 years later, the three friends are gone, and more of Goldin's images are absent of people altogether. Color-saturated landscapes, building interiors, and introspective human subjects convey a strong sense of the passage of time and its effect on personal histories. <p> The book is compact and the color photographs expertly reproduced on heavy paper stock. This design makes it very easy for readers to study both the photos and the accompanying writing, fittingly penned by the artist's friends and models Guido Costa and Cookie Mueller. <i>--Jordana Moskowitz</i></p></p><h2>Management</h2><p>This bestselling principles text vividly illustrates management theories by incorporating the perspectives of real-life managers.

Built on rocky hills, the city is surrounded on three sides by bay and ocean that can be seen from nearly everywhere within it. Precipitous cliffs face the city from across the Golden Gate, and the skyline to the north, east, and south is dominated by mountains. Occasional tremors from the San Andreas and related faults nearby remind us that the earth here is active. Until recently the rocks so abundantly exposed in San Francisco baffled geologists. Jumbled together without apparent order and lacking visible fossils, they defied explanation. The theory of plate tectonics has changed all that. We now have an explanation for the origin of the rocks of San Francisco, although it is anything but simple.</p></p><p><p>Clyde A. Wahrhaftig was an American geophysicist.

The title story recounts a Sergeant&#39;s meeting with a young girl before being sent into combat. When it was first published in &#34;The New Yorker&#34; in 1950 it was an immediate sensation and prompted a flood of readers&#39; fan-letters. &#39;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&#39; is the first of the author&#39;s stories to feature the Glass family, the loveable and idiosyncratic family who would appear in much of Salinger&#39;s later fiction. A haunting and unforgettable piece of writing, the story follows the eldest sibling, Seymour Glass, and his wife, Muriel, as they embark on an ill-fated honeymoon in Florida.</p><p>J.D. Salinger was born in 1919 and died in January 2010. He grew up in New York City, and wrote short stories from an early age, but his breakthrough came in 1948 with the publication in the New Yorker of &#39;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&#39;. The Catcher in the Rye was his first and only novel, published in 1951. It remains one of the most translated, taught and reprinted texts, and has sold some 65 million copies.

Chloï¿½ Sevigny has been a muse in the downtown creative scene for over three decades, beginning in the early &#x2019;90s when she modeled for Sassy, appeared in a Sonic Youth music video, and then starred in the controversial independent movie Kids (1995). Her quirky and avant-garde fashion sense was quickly noticed by indie magazines and the world&#x2019;s top photographers. Since then, she has starred in dozens of films and television series, in addition to starting a fashion label with the trendy global boutique Opening Ceremony. This volume is a deeply personal illustrated chronicle of the evolution of Sevigny&#x2019;s unique style throughout her career: from a teenage skater girl to award-winning film actress and fashion designer. The book includes early personal photos of Chloï¿½ taken by her high school friends; film stills; modeling appearances for brands such as Miu Miu and Chloï¿½; magazine editorials for Purple, i-D, and The Face by top photographers such as Mark Borthwick, Terry Richardson, and Juergen Teller; and homages by artists such as Elizabeth Peyton and Karen Kilimnik. Additionally, Sevigny shares some of her treasured personal memorabilia, such as casting fliers, Polaroids, zines, and pages from her day planners. This volume will appeal to the legions of global Chloï¿½ fans and fashion industry followers, as well as a mainstream audience who will find this book an inspirational style bible.</p><p>Chloï¿½ Sevigny is an award-winning American film actress, fashion designer, and former model. Some of her most notable roles were in Kids (1995), Boys Don&#39;t Cry (1999), American Psycho (2000), and the HBO television series Big Love, for which she received a Golden Globe in 2010. Kim Gordon is a visual artist and a founding member of the post-punk experimental rock band Sonic Youth."Model, actress and muse of independent cinema, Chloï¿½ Sevigny is a contemporary female icon who thinks outside the box." -<i>Muse Magazine</i><br><br>"Part of the pleasure of perusing&nbsp;<i>Chloï¿½ Sevigny</i>&nbsp;is precisely in re-experiencing this pre-Internet era of 'alternative' and 'independent' that Sevigny inspired with her mischievous, do-it-yourself aesthetic. Even as she joined larger Hollywood ensembles and accrued more mainstream success, her passion for the avant-garde has not waned. Moreover, the book highlights contemporary fashion's<b> extraordinary spirit of levity and inventiveness</b>, qualities for which she has been largely responsible." -<i>Rolling Stone<br><br></i>"Thus was born the retrospective album <i>Chloï¿½ Sevigny&nbsp;</i>(Rizzoli), a compilation of photographs, tear sheets, scrapbook pages, and other highly personal ephemera curated by the actor, designer, occasional <i>Vogue</i> model, and original street-style icon . . . the grainy photos in the book&nbsp;have an undeniably nostalgic appeal - in those antediluvian days we were still communicating largely without the help of computers, instead relying on the ancient machinery of typewriters, Polaroids, and Xeroxes." -<i>Vogue<br><br></i>"Sevigny's latest project aims to stitch together her diverse pursuits. , a photo book published by Rizzoli, due out tomorrow, collects a hundred and seventy images from the span of her career, taken by friends and collaborators including Harmony Korine, Mario Sorrenti, and Inez and Vinoodh, with essays by Kim Gordon and Natasha Lyonne. It's not an art book or a scrapbook, she says, but a fan book, in the vein of teen fanzine tributes to River Phoenix or Matt Dillon." -<i>The New Yorker</i><br><br>"As Rizzoli's new tome proves, little has changed since the '90s - Chloï¿½ is still <b>as cool as ever</b>." -<i>Harper's Bazaar</i><br><br>"Chloï¿½ Sevigny looks back on her three-decade oeuvre and delivers a deeply inviting visual anthology." -<i>Nylon Magazine</i><br><br>"Rizzoli's <i>Chloï¿½ Sevigny</i> catalogues the images, ephemera, and personal details [Chloe] feels best represent her . . ." -<i>V Magazine</i><br><br><i>"</i>Chloï¿½ Sevigny hit the big screen 20 years ago with<i> Kids</i> and later earned an Oscar nomination for <i>Boys Don't Cry </i>and a Golden Globe for <i>Big Love</i>.

A muse to film directors, designers, and musicians for over two decades, her latest venture is a self-titled book published by Rizzoli that chronicles her journey from a teen trawling skate parks in the early &#x2018;90s, to her career as an it-girl, actress, and model bar none." -<i>Yahoo!

He arrives in Moscow one hot summer afternoon with various alarming accomplices, including a demonic, fast-talking black cat. When he leaves, the asylums are full and the forces of law and order are in disarray. Only the Master, a man devoted to truth, and Margarita, the woman he loves, can resist the devil&#x2019;s onslaught. Brilliant and blackly comic, The Master and Margarita was repressed by Stalin&#x2019;s authorities and only published after the author&#x2019;s death.<br><br>The Vintage Classic Russians Series: Published for the 100th anniversary of the 1917 Russian Revolution, these are must-have, beautifully designed editions of six epic masterpieces that have survived controversy, censorship and suppression to influence decades of thought and artistic expression.</p><p>Surely no stranger work exists in the annals of protest literature than <i>The Master and Margarita</i>. Written during the Soviet crackdown of the 1930s, when Mikhail Bulgakov's works were effectively banned, it wraps its anti-Stalinist message in a complex allegory of good and evil. Or would that be the other way around? The book's chief character is Satan, who appears in the guise of a foreigner and self-proclaimed black magician named Woland. Accompanied by a talking black tomcat and a "translator" wearing a jockey's cap and cracked pince-nez, Woland wreaks havoc throughout literary Moscow. First he predicts that the head of noted editor Berlioz will be cut off; when it is, he appropriates Berlioz's apartment. (A puzzled relative receives the following telegram: "Have just been run over by streetcar at Patriarch's Ponds funeral Friday three afternoon come Berlioz.") Woland and his minions transport one bureaucrat to Yalta, make another one disappear entirely except for his suit, and frighten several others so badly that they end up in a psychiatric hospital. In fact, it seems half of Moscow shows up in the bin, demanding to be placed in a locked cell for protection. <p> Meanwhile, a few doors down in the hospital lives the true object of Woland's visit: the author of an unpublished novel about Pontius Pilate. This Master--as he calls himself--has been driven mad by rejection, broken not only by editors' harsh criticism of his novel but, Bulgakov suggests, by political persecution as well. Yet Pilate's story becomes a kind of parallel narrative, appearing in different forms throughout Bulgakov's novel: as a manuscript read by the Master's indefatigable love, Margarita, as a scene dreamed by the poet--and fellow lunatic--Ivan Homeless, and even as a story told by Woland himself. Since we see this narrative from so many different points of view, who is truly its author? Given that the Master's novel and this one end the same way, are they in fact the same book? These are only a few of the many questions Bulgakov provokes, in a novel that reads like a set of infinitely nested Russian dolls: inside one narrative there is another, and then another, and yet another. His devil is not only entertaining, he is <i>necessary</i>: "What would your good be doing if there were no evil, and what would the earth look like if shadows disappeared from it?"</p><p> Unsurprisingly--in view of its frequent, scarcely disguised references to interrogation and terror--Bulgakov's masterwork was not published until 1967, almost three decades after his death. Yet one wonders if the world was really ready for this book in the late 1930s, if, indeed, we are ready for it now. Shocking, touching, and scathingly funny, it is a novel like no other. Woland may reattach heads or produce 10-ruble notes from the air, but Bulgakov proves the true magician here. <i>The Master and Margarita</i> is a different book each time it is opened. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>The devil, disguised as a magician, descends upon Moscow in the 1930s with his riotous band, which includes a talking cat and an expert assassin. Together they succeed in comically befuddling a population which denies the devil&#39;s existence, even as it is confronted with the diabolic results of a magic act gone wrong. This visit to the capital of world atheism has several aims, one of which concerns the fate of the Master, a writer who has written a novel about Pontius Pilate, and is now in a mental hospital. Margarita, the despairing and daring heroine, becomes a witch in an effort to save the Master, and agrees to become the devil&#39;s hostess at his annual spring ball. By turns acidly satiric, fantastic, and ironically philosophical, this work constantly surprises and entertains, as the action switches back and forth between the Moscow of the 1930s and first-century Jerusalem.</p><h2>Health, Student Edition</h2><p>The new <em>Prentice Hall Health</em> program makes health exciting for students and provides teachers with the resources they need to support content and academic achievement.

Breckenridge Bender, a very rich American with a distinct resemblance to J.P. Morgan, arrives in England with the purpose of acquiring some very great art; he is directed to Dedborough, the estate of the debt-ridden Lord Theign. But plutocrat and aristocrat come into unexpected conflict when a young connoisseur, out to establish his own reputation, declares a prize painting from the lord's collection to be in fact an even rarer, and pricier, work than had been thought.<br><br>A popular success in its own day, but long unavailable since and now almost unknown, <i>The Outcry</i> is one of the most surprising and amusing of James's works. Here he explores questions of privilege and initiative, repute and honor, high art and base calculation, revisiting some of his favorite themes with a deft and winning touch.</p><p>Henry James (1843&#x2013;1916), the younger brother of the psychologist William James and one of the greatest of American writers, was born in New York but lived for most of his life in England.

But that characterization is unfair. In <em>Be Like the Fox</em>, Erica Benner sets the record straight: far from the ruthless &#x201c;Machiavellian&#x201d; henchman that people think he was, Machiavelli emerges here as a profound ethical thinker who fought to uphold high moral standards and restore the democratic freedoms of his beloved Florence.</p><p>Shaking the dust from history, Benner masterfully interweaves Machiavelli&#x2019;s words with those of his friends and enemies, giving us a biography with all the energy of fiction. Through dialogues and diaries, we witness dramatic episodes, including Savonarola&#x2019;s fiery sermons against the elite in Florence&#x2019;s piazza, Machiavelli&#x2019;s secret negotiations with Caterina Sforza at the court of Forlï¿½, and the Florentines&#x2019; frantic preparations to resist Pope Julius&#x2019;s plan to over-throw their Republic.</p><p>Benner relates how Machiavelli rose as an advisor in the Florentine Republic, advancing the city&#x2019;s interests as a diplomat and military strategist, only to become a political pariah when the Republic was defeated. His egalitarian politics made him an enemy of the Medici family, and his secular outlook put him at odds with religious zealots. But he soon learned to mask his true convictions, becoming a great artist of foxlike dissimulation. Machiavelli&#x2019;s masterpiece, <em>The Prince</em>, was in fact a critique of princely power, but the critique had to be veiled, written as it was after the Medici triumphed over the Republic.</p><p>In <em>Be Like the Fox</em>, the most accurate and compelling portrait of Machiavelli yet, Benner recounts the gripping story of a brilliant political thinker, showing that Machiavelli&#x2019;s ideas&#x2015;about democratic institutions, diplomacy, and freedom&#x2015;are more important than ever.</p></p><p>Erica Benner lives in Berlin. She is the author of several books, including Machiavelli&#x2019;s Ethics and Machiavelli&#x2019;s Prince: A New Reading. Formerly a Fellow at Yale University, Benner taught for many years at Oxford University and the London School of Economics.&#x201c;Erudite and engaging. . . .<em>Be Like the Fox</em>&nbsp;is not detached, archival history but a remarkable work of imaginative engagement backed by scholarly learning. Benner brings Machiavelli alive by weaving his words and those of his contemporaries into the narrative as a playwright might. . . . <em>Be Like the Fox</em>&nbsp;can be read with pleasure by anyone interested in the craft of politics and the life of ideas.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Edmund Fawcett, <em><em>New York Times Book Review</em></em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Lively, unshowily erudite, compulsively readable.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Terry Eagleton, <em><em>The Guardian</em></em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In this tightly composed narrative of Machiavelli&#x2019;s life and works, Benner argues that &#x2018;The Prince&#x2019; is a work of secret subversion, using irony and beguilement to advance a staunchly republican message. . . . [A] gripping portrait of a brilliant political thinker, who understood the dangers of authoritarianism and looked for ways to curb them even though independent speech had become impossible.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em><em>The New Yorker</em></em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Unconventional. . .&nbsp;Benner argues that in [his] turbulent, violent world, Machiavelli&#x2019;s most consistent advice favoured principle, restraint and respect for the rule of law, even in <em>The Prince. . . .&nbsp;</em>Compelling.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Julian Baggini, <em><em>Financial Times</em></em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Engaging, entertaining, splendidly colourful. . . . Brings to life a Machiavelli who's a man of considerable political principle. Benner does a wonderful job of bringing to life Florentine society &#x2013; the world of the piazzas, the courts, the battlefields. . . . A creative, very readable book with more than a little contemporary resonance.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Catherine Fletcher, <em><em>Literary Review</em> (UK)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A ripping read. . . . fascinating, charming, enjoyably unorthodox.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Tim Smith-Laing, <em>The Telegraph (UK)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Erica Benner succeeds brilliantly in overturning centuries-old received views of a seminal but misunderstood writer and thinker. Her enthralling and moving evocation of Machiavelli&#x2019;s turbulent career, set in the milieu in which he lived, also reveals how much he is our contemporary.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Rosamund Bartlett, author of <em>Tolstoy: A Russian Life</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Erica Benner&#x2019;s compelling book testifies to the eternal return of Machiavelli&#x2019;s puzzle: whether he was the voice of Satan, or the author who wanted to put morality on firmer human foundations by unveiling the empty moral platitudes that politicians used to shroud their foxy and ruthless behavior. Like a riveting novel, Benner&#x2019;s book guides us through Machiavelli&#x2019;s times and shows the variety of masks he put on, suggesting that the man behind them was less likely to compromise than his words might lead us to believe.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Nadia Urbinati, author of <em>Democracy Disfigured</em> and professor of political science, Columbia University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;No other writer about Machiavelli approaches the liveliness of Erica Benner. In <em>Be Like the Fox</em> she boldly confronts the most daunting obstacle to interpreting him: that being himself so foxy he rarely means quite what he writes. Drawing on his life and all his varied writings and inter-weaving these with the turbulent life of Florence in his day, she retrieves a Machiavelli who is not the promoter of crookedness but its critic, a friend of democracy and honest government whose heart is with the underdog.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Clifford Orwin, professor of political science, classics, and Jewish studies, Toronto University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;In Erica Benner&#x2019;s <em>Be Like the Fox</em>, Machiavelli&#x2015;in his own words the &#x2018;historian, the comic writer, the tragic author&#x2019;&#x2015;comes alive as the master of irony deployed in the service of justice, civic morality and the rule of law. This delightful and convincing account should be the final nail in the coffin of the derogatory term &#x2018;Machiavellian.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Samuel Bowles, author of <em>The Moral Economy: Why Good Incentives Are No Substitute for Good Citizens</em></strong></p><h2>Organizational Behavior: Science, The Real World, and You</h2><p>Guide today&#39;s students as they learn not only the concepts and theories that enhance the management of human behavior at work but also how to practice these skills with Nelson/Quick&#39;s ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR.

It is written with the humor, wisdom, and grace of a bygone era, yet spiced with the ultramodern savvy and the future-oriented vision of a twenty-year-old. What an extraordinary woman! What an extraordinary life!"--Chaka Fattah U.S. Representative (Pennsylvania)</p><p>In this inspiring memoir, a pioneering African-American educator tells the dramatic story of her greatest achievement--a guarantee to 116 students from Philadelphia&#39;s grittiest neighborhoods of a chance to go to college. She relates both the successes and the failures of these teenagers and provides valuable lessons about how individuals and communities can make positive change happen. The inspiring odyssey of a courageous inner city educator who pledged her fortune to kids at riskRuth Wright Hayre grew up in a close, genteel family that had prized learning since the days of the Civil War. At age ten, her grandfather, Richard Robert Wright, led by his remarkable mother, marched 200 miles to attend a school for emancipated slaves in a discarded railroad boxcar in Atlanta. When Union General Oliver Otis Howard came to the classroom and asked what message he should take back north, young Richard responded, in the famous exchange immortalized by poet John Greenleaf Whittier, "Sir, tell them we are rising."<p>More than a century later, Ruth Wright Hayre, like her great-grandmother, would lead children on a life-changing journey to learning. After a distinguished career as a teacher, principal, administrator, college professor, and finally as a member and president of the Philadelphia Board of Education, Hayre's faith in the power of education inspired her to take on her greatest challenge&#x2014;to create the "Tell Them We Are Rising" program. With that program she issued a challenge of her own to the sixth-graders in two schools in Philadelphia's grittiest neighborhoods: graduate from high school, and she would pay their college tuition.</p><p>This is the story of the family and traditions that inspired that phenomenal gift, which took 116 boys and girls through six years of public school life on the wings of one woman's determination to make a difference in their lives.</p><p>While the problems confronting the octogenarian "grandmom" and her "Risers" were formidable&#x2014;discipline, pregnancies, lack of motivation, and a disturbing acceptance of the possibility of death at an early age&#x2014;Hayre forthrightly proclaims "this is a book about winning. It is also a book about loss&#x2014;but not about losing." It is about overcoming fierce struggles and sorrows with newfound reserves of untapped strengths, the gift of mother wit, and the resilience of grace.</p><p>Hayre introduces us to Tenishia, Wendell, Shawn, Yvonne, Latika, and Hasaan, among others, for Tell Them We Are Rising is also their story. It is the story of a young boy determined to attend the high school of his choice, even if it means trekking six hours to and from classes. It is the story of a young girl raising her brothers and sisters in a home where chaos is a constant, and still managing to graduate on time. Above all, Tell Them We Are Rising is a celebration of a dedicated teacher whose guidance, generosity, and vision transformed despair into hope for a generation of children.</p><p>"Tell Them We Are Rising is a wonderful, inspiring story of service, commitment, generosity, love, and hope.

The book is in excellent condition.</p><p></p><h2>Mahogany: The Costs of Luxury in Early America</h2><p><p>In the mid-eighteenth century, colonial Americans became enamored with the rich colors and silky surface of mahogany. This exotic wood, imported from the West Indies and Central America, quickly displaced local furniture woods as the height of fashion. Over the next century, consumer demand for mahogany set in motion elaborate schemes to secure the trees and transform their rough-hewn logs into exquisite objects. But beneath the polished gleam of this furniture lies a darker, hidden story of human and environmental exploitation.</p><p><i>Mahogany</i> traces the path of this wood through many hands, from source to sale: from the enslaved African woodcutters, including skilled &#x201c;huntsmen&#x201d; who located the elusive trees amidst dense rainforest, to the ship captains, merchants, and timber dealers who scrambled after the best logs, to the skilled cabinetmakers who crafted the wood, and with it the tastes and aspirations of their diverse clientele. As the trees became scarce, however, the search for new sources led to expanded slave labor, vicious competition, and intense international conflicts over this diminishing natural resource. When nineteenth-century American furniture makers turned to other materials, surviving mahogany objects were revalued as antiques evocative of the nation's past.</p><p>Jennifer Anderson offers a dynamic portrait of the many players, locales, and motivations that drove the voracious quest for mahogany to adorn American parlors and dining rooms. This complex story reveals the cultural, economic, and environmental costs of America&#x2019;s growing self-confidence and prosperity, and how desire shaped not just people&#x2019;s lives but the natural world.</p></p><p>Jennifer L. Anderson is Associate Professor of History at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.&#x201c;[A] fascinating book about the most coveted wood in early America and, indeed, the 18th-century British Empire... This enlightening...study does for mahogany what others long ago did for sugar and tobacco, chocolate and coffee, rubber and bananas... From an impressive number of archival sources [Anderson] has assembled a vibrant collective portrait of colonial grandees&#x2015;Benjamin and William Franklin, among them&#x2015;declaring their social dominance through hard-won mahogany possessions.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Kirk Davis Swinehart</b><b>, </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;From the 1720s to the mid-19th century, mahogany was the preeminent medium for conspicuous consumption on both sides of the Atlantic... However, as Anderson&#x2019;s superb [book] makes abundantly clear, the polished luster of these immaculate objects came from exploitative labor practices, ecological devastation, and phenomenal business failures, all of which attested to the commodity&#x2019;s natural and human cost... Anderson&#x2019;s is a remarkable contribution to Atlantic history that...will be much enjoyed by anyone interested in the history of trade in colonial America and the Caribbean.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Brian Odom</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Anderson details the history of the search for, trade in, and use of mahogany. Though the title directs readers to early America, for Anderson, America is in reality the Atlantic world. Most of the author&#x2019;s time is spent among the islands of the Caribbean or near the Bay of Honduras in Belize, where mahogany was harvested. Anderson paints a picture of the Atlantic world in which travel and trade were the norm and families lived and worked up and down the coasts of North and Central America as well as on numerous Caribbean islands.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>S. A. Jacobe</b><b>, </b><b><i>Choice</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Anderson&#x2019;s evocative and stunning <i>Mahogany</i> reminds us of both the deep ties between humans and trees and the sharp consequences of allowing our passion for beauty to trump nature&#x2019;s capacity to sustain a species.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Peter C. Mancall, author of <i>Fatal Journey: The Final Expedition of Henry Hudson</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Anderson has crafted a rich blend of the cultural history of mahogany, the social history of logging, the economic history of the mahogany timber trade, the environmental history of Caribbean forests, and the history of the natural history of mahogany. The result is an elegant essay in Atlantic history.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>J. R. McNeill, author of <i>Mosquito Empires: Ecology and War in the Greater Caribbean, 1620&#x2013;1914</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This superb study of a vital early American commodity focuses on its production, distribution, and consumption from the age of sail to the era of steam. Mahogany&#x2019;s sumptuousness came at a severe price, somewhat offset by enhanced knowledge of its properties and opportunities in its harvesting. With its highly nuanced and sophisticated argument, this book deserves a wide readership.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Philip Morgan, author of <i>Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;&#x2018;When you drink the water, think of the well-digger,&#x2019; is folk wisdom around the world.

The authors present the common systems of tonal organization in Western music, focusing on general tendencies and patterns of behavior across style and period boundaries. Each chapter includes a step-by-step presentation of the relevant musical context with extensive examples as illustration. Writing assignments allow students to experience firsthand the active musical process as they progress from simple chord melodies to more complex harmonic relationships. Each exercise builds on and develops from the previous assignments. More than 1400 musical examples are included in this text to illustrate particular concepts in a variety of musical contexts. Some 600 of these examples are drawn from folksong, popular music, hymns and chorales, and the standard repertoire.The authors have developed a unique approach to the teaching of this complex subject. They have used this approach in their own classrooms with their own students. The &#34;Examples for Study&#34; in each chapter are models for writing drawn from assignments submitted by the many students who have studied with this approach over the past decade.</p><p><b>Charles Horton</b> teaches music theory and analysis, piano, and twentieth-century music history at the School of Music at the University of Manitoba.

The bizarre psychic world she paints in overly lyrical prose will be familiar to readers of her popular Star Woman and Jaguar Woman. Dolphins transmit a dream-vision to her via a eucalyptus tree that acts as an antenna; she peers through magic crystals inside her mind; encounters with hostile spirits test her spiritual powers. Among the lessons she learns are that we create our enemies within ourselves and that each of us must balance female and male energies.

Andrews's ( Star Woman ) first-person narrative combines pop- mysticism with bits and pieces of aboriginal myth, producing a "nonfiction fantasy" that will appeal primarily to readers familiar with the author's previous titles.

Related to intention is the concept of mindfulness - the awareness that arises through intentionally attending to oneself and others in an open, caring, and nonjudgmental way.

Everyone in the country is maladjusted. Doesn&#39;t seem possible, does it? Welcome to the world of Dr. Superb, the sole remaining psychotherapist. Philip K. Dick tells a story of desperate love, lethal body odour and an attempted fascistic takeover of the USA and shows that there is always another layer of conspiracy beneath the one we see.</p><p>On a ravaged Earth, fate and circumstances bring together a disparate group of characters, including a fascist with dreams of a coup, a composer who plays his instrument with his mind, a First Lady who calls all the shots, and the world&#x2019;s last practicing therapist. And they all must contend with an underclass that is beginning to ask a few too many questions, aided by a man called Loony Luke and his very persuasive pet alien. &nbsp; In classic Philip K. Dick fashion, <i>The Simulacra</i> combines time travel, psychotherapy, telekinesis, androids, and Neanderthal-like mutants to create a rousing, mind-bending story where there are conspiracies within conspiracies and nothing is ever what it seems.<br><br>Over a career that spanned three decades, Philip K. Dick (1928&#x2013;1982) wrote 121 short stories and 45 novels, establishing himself as one of the most visionary authors of the twentieth century. His work is included in the Library of America and has been translated into more than twenty-five languages. Eleven works have been adapted to film, including <i>Blade Runner</i> (based on <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>), <i>Total Recall</i>, <i>Minority Report</i>, and <i>A Scanner Darkly</i>.<br><br>Set in the middle of the twenty-first century, <b>The Simulacra</b> is the story of an America where the whole government is a fraud and the President is an android. Against this backdrop Dr. Superb, the sole remaining psychotherapist, is struggling to practice in a world full of the maladjusted. Ian Duncan is desperately in love with the first lady, Nicole Thibideaux, who he has never met. Richard Kongrosian refuses to see anyone because he is convinced his body odor is lethal. And the fascistic Bertold Goltz is trying to overthrow the government. With wonderful aplomb, Philip K. Dick brings this story to a crashing conclusion and in classic fashion shows there is always another layer of conspiracy beneath the one we see.</p><h2>What Is Life?</h2><p>Half a century ago, before the discovery of DNA, the Austrian physicist and philosopher Erwin Schrï¿½dinger inspired a generation of scientists by rephrasing the fascinating philosophical question: <i>What is life? </i>Using their expansive understanding of recent science to wonderful effect, acclaimed authors Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan revisit this timeless question in a fast-moving, wide-ranging narrative that combines rigorous science with philosophy, history, and poetry. The authors move deftly across a dazzling array of topics&#x2015;from the dynamics of the bacterial realm, to the connection between sex and death, to theories of spirit and matter. They delve into the origins of life, offering the startling suggestion that life&#x2015;not just human life&#x2015;is free to act and has played an unexpectedly large part in its own evolution. Transcending the various formal concepts of life, this captivating book offers a unique overview of life&#x2019;s history, essences, and future.<br><br>Supplementing the text are stunning illustrations that range from the smallest known organism (Mycoplasma bacteria) to the largest (the biosphere itself). Creatures both strange and familiar enhance the pages of <i>What Is Life?</i> Their existence prompts readers to reconsider preconceptions not only about life but also about their own part in it.</p><p>&#x201c;In <i>What Is Life?</i> Margulis and Sagan have rephrased the answer to Schrï¿½dinger&#x2019;s brilliant question by means of a new and spirited explanation of the emergent levels of biological organization. . . .

Thanks to this pocket version of the text I am able to review chapters in half the time. I also recommend the textbook which provides detail description of figures that may not be covered in the pocket companion. </p> <p>Pretty good text and a must for serious advanced physiology students who are headed toward medical or advanced nursing/PA degrees. It helps to simplify and consolidate the immense amount of minute and detailed info stocked up in the big text. </p> <p>I wish many other books with complex topics had a pocket companion comparable to this one. If the topic is important to your success, then having the pocket companion is indispensable. I see the pocket companion as the architect's view (high level design) of physiology and the first step to learning. Depending on interest and time, you can selectively drill down into the textbook to explain topics of greater importance to you. If a particular topic is not that important you can just read the companion. I have already swept through many chapters and when I hit a chapter I wanted to understand in more detail, such as sports physiology, I went off and read the entire textbook chapter. When other chapters have more detail then I need I stick with the companion. </p> <p>Count yourself lucky to have this pocket companion as a first "cut" to the knowledge in the textbook, it will help immensely during the absorption and after for the quick and convenient recall.</p> <p> I have been using this book, along with the 'Big Daddy' version for preparation for my surgical primary exams. In summary, it's gold. No, it won't tell you everything that the big book does, and certainly not as much detail as thicker texts like Ganong, but I think that is the real benefit of it. ALL IT HAS IS THE BASIC FACTS, and that is all you need to grasp the concepts and therefore answer most questions. If you are looking for a high distinction on your exams, then take a month off work and read Ganong. If you have less than a week and are trying just to pass, then 'Baby Guyton' is gold. Five stars. </p></p><h2>WEST</h2><p><p>Imagine your Western Civilization students evaluating evidence, making connections, and thinking analytically about the past and present.

Thayer was a wealthy publisher, poet, and aesthete who led an intense public life that included the editorship of the prominent literary journal <i>The Dial</i> and friendships with literary luminaries such as e. e. cummings. In the 1920s, Thayer went on an art-buying spree in London, Paris, Berlin, and Vienna, acquiring approximately 600 works of art. Among these are particularly provocative drawings and watercolors by Klimt, Schiele, and Picasso, at a time when these works were little known or appreciated. This book showcases 52&nbsp;of the&nbsp;rarely seen works&#x2014;which have now taken their place as modernist erotic masterpieces&#x2014;and presents them within the context of the collector&#x2019;s remarkable life and tempestuous times.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Evocative and often erotic works by Klimt, Schiele, and Picasso are discussed and examined within the context of the remarkable life of the man who collected them.<br> &nbsp;<b>Sabine Rewald</b> is Jacques and Natasha Gelman Curator for Modern Art in the Department of Modern and Contemporary Art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.&nbsp;<b>James Dempsey</b> is an instructor at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the author of <i>The Tortured Life of Scofield Thayer.</i>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Heart of the Buddha (Dharma Ocean Series, 1)</h2><p>This compelling collection of essays, talks, and seminars by Chï¿½gyam Trungpa presents the basic teachings of Buddhism as they relate to everyday life.

Now fully revised and updated, <i>Looking Beyond the Ivy League</i> offers a step-by-step guide to selecting the right institution, a checklist of specific questions to ask when visiting a college, the secrets to creating good applications and good applicants, and much more. With as few as one-third of college students remaining at the institution they entered as freshmen, finding the right college is harder than ever before. This book makes it easier for students and their parents.</p><p><b>Loren Pope</b> was education editor of the <b>New York Times</b> in the 1950s. In 1965 he opened the College Placement Bureau in Washington, D.C., to help families of college--bound students make informed choices. He is the author of <b>Looking Beyond the Ivy League</b> and has written numerous articles about the college application procGrade 10 Up --An authoritative, carefully expressed argument for aiming at a small liberal-arts college rather than a large, impersonal university. Pope claims that there is "a lot of non-Ivy quality available" for many kinds of students, and describes several colleges and programs to back up his points. This information, however, is limited. He describes ways in which learning-disabled students or low high-school achievers can obtain a college education, and includes sensible advice on the application/selection process and financial aid. Although some may justifiably argue that the picture of large universities isn't always quite as glum as he paints, Pope's recommendations and concerns are usually on target. His style is not upbeat like many guides of this type, such as Edward B. Fiske's How to Get into the Right College (Times, 1988), but it is practical and filled with wisdom and good examples. Students who are as interested in the social scene or extracurricular activities as they are in academics will not find the book as useful as those students primarily concerned with serious learning. --Diane P.

Packer's <i>Drinking Coffee Elsewhere</i> has attracted as much book-world buzz as a triple espresso. Yet, surprisingly, there are no gimmicks in these eight stories. Their combination of tenderness, humor, and apt, unexpected detail set them apart. In the title story (published in the <i>New Yorker</i>'s summer 2000 Debut Fiction issue), a Yale freshman is sent to a psychotherapist who tries to get her--black, bright, motherless, possibly lesbian--to stop "pretending," when she is sure that "pretending" is what got her this far. "Speaking in Tongues" describes the adventures of an Alabama church girl of 14 who takes a bus to Atlanta to try to find the mother who gave her up. Looking around the Montgomery Greyhound station, she wonders if it has changed much since the Reverend King's days. She "tried to imagine where the 'Colored' and 'Whites Only' signs would have hung, then realized she didn't have to. All five blacks waited in one area, all three whites in another." Packer's prose is wielded like a kitchen knife, so familiar to her hand that she could use it with her eyes shut.

The immensely popular Victorian novelist Wilkie Collins has long been a favorite with those who find themselves in the mood to &#34;read&#34; read. Originally published in 1857, &#34;The Dead Secret,&#34; with its powerful blend of sensational drama and gripping psychological portraiture, shows Collins to be a master storyteller indeed.English novelist and playwright Wilkie Collins was a prolific writer with a body of work comprising thirty novels, over sixty short stories, more than a dozen plays, and a wide range of non-fiction pieces. Collins is best known for his novels The Woman in White, an early sensation novela genre combining shocking gothic horror with everyday domestic settingsand The Moonstone, which is credited as one of the first modern mystery novels. In the 1850s Collins met Charles Dickens and the two struck up a friendship, which lead to Collins becoming a frequent contributor to Dickens s journals Household Words and All the Year Round. Many of his stories have been adapted for film, including Basil, A Terribly Strange Bed, The Moonstone and The Woman in White.

They arrived in Europe in the ninth century and spread across the continent from East to West, reaching England in the 15th century and Scandinavia by the end of the 16th century. A nomadic people, these wanderers were reviled by local populaces wherever they went and regarded as misfits, intruders, foreigners, and thieves. <br><br>Drawing on a number of sources never before available outside of Eastern Europe, Claude Lecouteux reconstructs the gypsy oral tradition to provide a comprehensive A-to-Z look at gypsy mythology, including their folktales, rites, songs, nursery rhymes, jokes, and magical traditions. His main source is material collected by Heinrich Adalbert von Wlislocki (1856-1907), an ethnologist who lived with gypsies in Romania, Transylvania, and Hungary in the latter half of the 19th century. He presents the origin myths of the gypsies, legends which form the ancestral memory of the gypsy tribes and often closely touch on their daily life. <br><br>Lecouteux explores the full range of supernatural beings that inhabit the gypsy world, including fairies, undines, ogres, giants, dog-people, and demons, and he examines the three major settings of gypsy folktales--the forest, the waters, and the mountain, which they worshiped as a sacred being in its own right. He also reveals how coexisting with peoples of different religions led the gypsies to adapt or borrow stories and figures from these groups, and he shows how the religious concepts and sacred stories of the Rom testify to a profound syncretism of pagan traditions and Christianity. <br><br>Complete with rare illustrations and information from obscure sources appearing for the first time in English, this detailed reference work represents an excellent resource for scholars and those seeking to reconnect to their forgotten gypsy heritage.</p><p>Claude Lecouteux is a former professor of medieval literature and civilization at the Sorbonne. He is the author of numerous books on medieval and pagan afterlife beliefs and magic, including <i>The Book of Grimoires</i>, <i>Dictionary of Ancient Magic Words and Spells</i>, and <i>The Tradition of Household Spirits</i>. He lives in Paris.<b>Introduction: The People of Oral Tradition</b> <br><br>The Rom, better known in many countries as &#x201c;Gypsies,&#x201d; were a nomadic people suffering from the inveterate hostility of local populaces who regarded them as misfits, intruders, and foreigners. Sedentary peoples have always viewed wanderers with suspicion, and Gypsies have been attributed with every failing over the centuries and subject to much persecution. <br><br>The religious concepts of the Rom testify to a profound syncretism of pagan and Christian elements. Having coexisted with numerous peoples of different religions over the course of their tribulations, the Gypsies have certainly borrowed elements from them, but they nevertheless maintained an old pagan pool of beliefs that reveals its existence in the worship of nature, stars, and the elements. <br><br>As the Gypsies are a people of an oral culture, credit is due to the collectors of folk traditions and ethnologists for having assembled the materials from which it is possible to form some idea of the mythology of the Gypsies. <br><br>DICTIONARY OF GYPSY MYTHOLOGY <br><br>ENGAGEMENT: A week before the wedding day, the fiancï¿½es go to the nearest lake or river at night where they stick candles in the bank or hang them from a bush. Among the nomadic Gypsies of Transylvania, this is seen as an offering intended to ensure the fruitfulness of the marriage. If the wind blows the candles out, it is viewed as a bad omen, and the betrothed couple hasten to toss apples and eggs into the water to placate the water spirits. It is believed that the fiancï¿½ or fiancï¿½e whose candle is extinguished first will be the first to die. <br><br>If a Bohemian wishes to get married, he hangs a red scarf on the tent of the person he has chosen. If she takes the scarf, it is a sign that she has accepted his marriage proposal. <br><br>Folk tales mention another rite used to determine one&#x2019;s future wife. All the young women of marriageable age are made to line up in the village and the suitors are assembled at the end of the meadow. Each of them throws an egg at the one who has caught his eye, and is obliged to marry whoever the egg hits. In one story, one of the eggs thrown this way strikes a frog who is subsequently revealed to be a young woman who had been metamorphosed. &#xf026;&#xf020;<br><br>Wlislocki, Heinrich von, <i>Mï¿½rchen und Sagen</i>, nï¿½ 24; Wlislocki, Heinrich von, <i>Volksdichtungen</i>..., nï¿½ 64. <br><br><b>GLOW WORM</b> (<b><i>grinda somnï¿½kube</i>):</b> The Gypsies believe that this creature lingers around places where gold has been buried.

According to one legend, when the trades were being awarded to the different people, the Gypsy hid behind God who granted him a portion of what the people gathered there had received. This is why the Gypsies have no country, are scattered across the world, and have to beg them for their portion. <br><br>Another legend says how when fleeing to escape the gaze of God, the Gypsies colored their faces black, tore their clothing, hid beneath a bridge, and waited. When God came along, they tried to scare him. He looked at them and said: &#x201c;Your fate will be to always roam!&#x201d; <br><br>When God divvied up lands and goods, he overlooked the Gypsies and gave them barren lands, authorizing them to steal and cheat. And when he gave everyone their share of destinies, the Devil was their lot. <br><br>It is also said, in the myth of the Egyptian origin of the Gypsies, that Pharavono (Pharaoh) irritated Moses and that God then cursed him to wander over the earth with his people. &#xf046;&#xf020; <br><br>Pharavono &#xf026; <br><br>Nounev, Y., &#x201c;Legends,&#x201d; 49; Kabakova G., <i>Contes et Lï¿½gendes tsiganes</i> 67, 76; Kenrick, D., Golemanov, D., <i>Three Gypsy tales from the Balkans</i>, 60; Obert, nï¿½ 30. <br><br><b>ILLITERACY</b>: The Gypsies regard their lack of a written culture as a curse and have a number of legends that explain why. One shows how Dundra, the messenger of God, revealed to them their secret laws and had them written down in a book. The Gypsies left India for Chaldea, but when this country could no longer feed them, the mages ordered them to separate. The most courageous of them returned to India with the sacred books and, today, no one knows what ever 4 became of them. <br><br>According to another tradition, God came down to earth to give the Gypsies an alphabet, but the only person he could find was an old man accompanied by a donkey because everyone else had gone off to harvest the fruit of the blackthorn. He gave this old man the alphabet written out on a cabbage leaf, but the donkey ate it and thus the Gypsies do no not have an alphabet. <br><br>Zanko, the chieftain of the Chalderash tribe lamented in 1955: &#x201c;We have no right to a writing. This is our curse.&#x201d; According to another tradition, it was their punishment for forging the nails that were used on Christ&#x2019;s cross. On the other hand, God awarded them the talent to know how to organize festivities and celebrations. <br><br>In 1837, Michel de Kogalnitchan (Mihail Kog&#x103;lniceanu) observed: &#x201c;The Gypsies still have no alphabet and they undoubtedly will never have one, for as they become more civilized, they will start experiencing new needs and will not feel the need to preserve a language as defective as theirs.&#x201d; <br><br>Alako, Pharavono &#xf026;&#xf020;<br><br>Berger, Hermann, &#x201c;Mythologie der Zigeuner,&#x201d; 810, de Ville F., <i>Tziganes, tï¿½moins des temps,</i> 69&#x2013;71; Kabakova G., <i>Contes et Lï¿½gendes tsiganes</i>, 68; <i>Zanko, chef tribal chez les Chalderash</i>, 13, 31; Kogalnitchan Michel de, <i>Esquisse sur l&#x2019;histoire, les moeurs et la langue des Cigains connus en France sous le nom de Bohï¿½miens</i>, Berlin: Librairie Behr, 1837, 36.</p><h2>Appointment in Samarra (Modern Library)</h2><p>A twentieth-century classic, <b>Appointment in Samarra</b><i> </i>is the first and most widely read book by the writer Fran Leibowitz called &#x201c;the real F.

Conventionally viewed as worthless, incapable of sustained policy, and significant only for his sporadic displays of ill-directed energy or a stubborn adherence to greedy and ambitious favorites, he has been presented as fit only to be deposed and replaced by someone more worthy of the throne.<br><br> This definitive biography, the fruit of a lifetime&#x2019;s study, does not present Edward II as a heroic or successful king: his deposition after a turbulent reign of nearly twenty years is proof enough that it went terribly wrong. But Seymour Phillips&#x2019; scrutiny of the multitude of available sources shows that a richer picture emerges, in line with the complexity of events and of the man himself. If Edward II was not a successful king, he was not fundamentally different in many ways from most English monarchs. The biography strikes a deft balance, taking full account of the problems the king faced in England, Scotland, and Ireland and in his relations with France. It also tackles the contentious issue of whether Edward II did not die in 1327, murdered under barbaric circumstances, but lived on as a captive in England and then a wanderer on the Continent. Eight hundred years on, a king&#x2019;s life is properly examined.</p><p><b>Seymour Phillips</b> is emeritus professor of medieval history, University College, Dublin, and a Member of the Royal Irish Academy."Phillips' book will stand for the foreseeable future as the definitive work . . . invigorating . . . a joy to read."--Steve Donoghue, "Open Letters Monthly"<br>--Steve Donoghue "Open Letters Monthly "</p><h2>I Shop Therefore I Am: Compulsive Buying and the Search for Self</h2><p>Compulsive buying is a serious, often secretive affliction, with profound emotional, social, occupational, and financial consequences. As many as a quarter of us have problems with buying, and studies suggest that between one and six percent of the population are full-fledged compulsive buyers. <i>I Shop,Therefore I Am: Compulsive Buying and the Search for Self</i> brings together, for the first time, the most important thinking about this disorder. As more and more therapists encounter compulsive buying (whether as a presenting problem or revealed in the course of ongoing therapy), the need for an in-depth clinical understanding of the disorder has grown. Dr. Benson has responded admirably to that need with a practical, comprehensive, and wonderfully readable work. <br><br> While the book focuses a wide-angled lens on the many aspects of compulsive buying, it emphasizes understanding the disorder as a desperate search for self in people whose identity is not securely established. It defines the syndrome of compulsive consumption, examines the range and variations within it, discusses assessment and associated disorders, and delineates successful treatment modalities. Offering insights from a broad spectrum of therapies&#x2013;psychopharmacology, psychodynamic therapy, cognitive-behavioral treatment, couples and group therapy, self-help, and financial counseling&#x2013;this book is an indispensable toolbox for the increasing number of therapists who see patients with shopping, buying, or debting problems.<br><i>A Jason Aronson Book</i></p><p><b>April Benson</b>, Ph.D., is a co-founder of the Center for the Study of Anorexia and Bulimia and a member of the Board of Directors, Institute for Contemporary Psychotherapy, both in New York City. She has worked on the problem of compulsive shopping for more than a decade&#x2015;doing research, treating patients, and training therapists&#x2015;and has developed a comprehensive treatment program to help eliminate it. She has written about the treatment of compulsive buying and about social factors, social costs, and public policy related to compulsive buying and been quoted in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Time Magazine</i>, <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>, and <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>.

Using current contributions from infant research, motivational systems theory, self psychology, and relational psychoanalytic perspectives, Dr. Benson and her contributors add to the literature on shopping by indicating its self-sustaining and self-enhancing aspects.

The elderly Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert had planned on adopting a boy to help Matthew with the chores on their Prince Edward Island farm. What are they to do with the red-haired, high-spirited girl who arrives instead?<br><br> <i>Anne of Avonlea</i><br> It seemed only yesterday that the skinny, freckle-faced redhead had first come to the island. Now here is Anne, teaching at the Avonlea school, 16, pretty, and all grown up. Well, not quite grown up. In fact, Anne is not very different from her restless young pupils&#x2014;mischievous and spirited as ever and headed for hilarious predicaments with a cranky new neighbor, a hungry Jersey cow, a parrot with an embarrassing vocabulary, and a truly dreadful mistake!<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Anne of the Island</i><br> New adventures lie ahead as Anne Shirley packs her bags, waves good-bye to childhood, and heads for Redmond College. With old friend Prissy Grant waiting in the bustling city of Kingsport and frivolous new pal Philippa Gordon at her side, Anne tucks her memories of rural Avonlea away and discovers life on her own terms, filled with surprises . . . including a marriage proposal from the worst fellow imaginable, the sale of her very first story, and tragedy that teaches her a painful lesson.</p><p>When Marilla Cuthbert's brother, Matthew, returns home to Green Gables with a chatty redheaded orphan girl, Marilla exclaims, "But we asked for a boy. We have no use for a girl." It's not long, though, before the Cuthberts can't imagine how they could ever do without young Anne of Green Gables--but not for the original reasons they sought an orphan. Somewhere between the time Anne "confesses" to losing Marilla's amethyst pin (which she never took) in hopes of being allowed to go to a picnic, and when Anne accidentally dyes her hated carrot-red hair green, Marilla says to Matthew, "One thing's for certain, no house that Anne's in will ever be dull." And no book that she's in will be, either. This adapted version of the classic, <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>, introduces younger readers to the irrepressible heroine of L.M. Montgomery's many stories. Adapter M.C. Helldorfer includes only a few of Anne's mirthful and poignant adventures, yet manages to capture the freshness of one of children's literature's spunkiest, most beloved characters. There's just enough to make beginning readers want more--luckily, there's a lot more in the originals! Illustrator Ellen Beier creates vibrant pictures to portray the beauty of the land around Green Gables and the spirited nature of Anne herself.

But here she was, ten years later, thirty years old, and still in the job she&#x2019;d grown to love despite its challenges. Her new batch of ninth-ï¿½graders was starting Pride and Prejudice, and their first homework had been to rewrite the opening sentence of Jane Austen&#x2019;s novel, always a fun activity and a good way for her to get to know her students better.<br><br>After Alys took attendance, she opened a fresh box of multicolored chalks and invited the girls to share their sentences on the blackboard. The first to jump up was Rose-ï¿½Nama, a crusader for duty and decorum, and one of the more trying students. Rose-ï¿½Nama deliberately bypassed the colored chalks for a plain white one, and Alys braced herself for a reimagined sentence exulting a traditional life&#x2014;ï¿½marriage, children, death. As soon as Rose-ï¿½Nama ended with mere seconds it takes for her to accept a proposal, the class erupted into cheers, for it was true: A ring did possess magical powers to transform into pauper or princess. Rose-ï¿½Nama gave a curtsy and, glancing defiantly at Alys, returned to her desk.<br><br>&#x201c;Good job,&#x201d; Alys said. &#x201c;Who wants to go next?&#x201d;<br><br>As hands shot up, she glanced affectionately at the girls at their wooden desks, their winter uniforms impeccably washed and pressed by dhobis and maids, their long braids (for good girls did not get a boyish cut like Alys&#x2019;s) draped over their books, and she wondered who they&#x2019;d end up becoming by the end of high school. She recalled herself at their age&#x2014;ï¿½an eager-ï¿½to-ï¿½learn though ultimately naï¿½ve Ms. Know-ï¿½It-ï¿½All.<br><br>&#x201c;Miss Alys, me me me,&#x201d; the class clown said, pumping her hand energetically.<br><br>Alys nodded, and the girl selected a blue chalk and began to write.<br><br>It is a truth universally acknowledged that a young girl in possession of a pretty face, a fair complexion, a slim figure, and good height is not going to happily settle for a very ugly husband if he doesn&#x2019;t have enough money, unless she has the most incredible bad luck (which my cousin does).<br><br>The class exploded into laughter and Alys smiled too.<br><br>&#x201c;My cousin&#x2019;s biggest complaint,&#x201d; the girl said, her eyes twinkling, &#x201c;is that he&#x2019;s so hairy. Miss Alys, how is it fair that girls are expected to wax everywhere but boys can be as hairy as gorillas?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Double standards,&#x201d; Alys said.<br><br>&#x201c;Oof,&#x201d; Rose-ï¿½Nama said. &#x201c;Which girl wants a mustache and a hairy back? I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>A chorus of, I don&#x2019;ts filled the room, and Alys was glad to see all the class energized and participating.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t either,&#x201d; Alys said complacently, &#x201c;but the issue is that women don&#x2019;t seem to have a choice that is free from judgment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Miss Alys,&#x201d; called out a popular girl. &#x201c;Can I go next?&#x201d;<br><br>It is unfortunately not a truth universally acknowledged that it is better to be alone than to have fake friendships.<br><br>As soon as she finished the sentence, the popular girl tossed the pink chalk into the box and glared at another girl across the room. Great, Alys thought, as she told her to sit down; they&#x2019;d still not made up. Alys was known as the teacher you could go to with any issue and not be busted, and both girls had come to her separately, having quarreled over whether one could have only one best friend. Ten years ago, Alys would have panicked at such disruptions. Now she barely blinked. Also, being one of five sisters had its perks, for it was good preparation for handling classes full of feisty girls.<br><br>Another student got up and wrote in red:<br><br>It is a truth universally acknowledged that every marriage, no matter how good, will have ups and downs.<br><br>&#x201c;This class is a wise one,&#x201d; Alys said to the delighted girl.<br><br>The classroom door creaked open from the December wind, a soft whistling sound that Alys loved. The sky was darkening and rain dug into the school lawn, where, weather permitting, classes were conducted under the sprawling century-ï¿½old banyan tree and the girls loved to let loose and play rowdy games of rounders and cricket. Cold air wafted into the room and Alys wrapped her shawl tightly around herself. She glanced at the clock on the mildewed wall.<br><br>&#x201c;We have time for a couple more sentences,&#x201d; and she pointed to a shy girl at the back. The girl took a green chalk and, biting her lip, began to write:<br><br>It is a truth universally acknowledged that if you are the daughter of rich and generous parents, then you have the luxury to not get married just for security.<br><br>&#x201c;Wonderful observation,&#x201d; Alys said kindly, for, according to Dilipabad&#x2019;s healthy rumor mill, the girl&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s business was currently facing setbacks. &#x201c;But how about the daughter earn a good income of her own and secure this freedom for herself?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Miss,&#x201d; the girl said quietly as she scuttled back to her chair.<br><br>Rose-ï¿½Nama said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Western conditioning to think independent women are better than homemakers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No one said anything about East, West, better, or worse,&#x201d; Alys said. &#x201c;Being financially independent is not a Western idea. The Prophet&#x2019;s wife, Hazrat Khadijah, ran her own successful business back in the day and he was, to begin with, her employee.&#x201d;<br><br>Rose-ï¿½Nama frowned. &#x201c;Have you ever reimagined the first sentence?&#x201d;<br><br>Alys grabbed a yellow chalk and wrote her variation, as she inevitably did every year, ending with the biggest flourish of an exclamation point yet.<br><br>It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single woman in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a husband!<br><br>&#x201c;How,&#x201d; Alys said, &#x201c;does this gender-ï¿½switch from the original sentence make you feel? Can it possibly be true or can you see the irony, the absurdity, more clearly now?&#x201d;<br><br>The classroom door was flung open and Tahira, a student, burst in. She apologized for being late even as she held out her hand, her fingers splayed to display a magnificent four-ï¿½carat marquis diamond ring.<br><br>&#x201c;It happened last night! Complete surprise!&#x201d; Tahira looked excited and nervous. &#x201c;Ammi came into my bedroom and said, &#x2018;Put away your homework-ï¿½shomework, you&#x2019;re getting engaged.&#x2019; Miss Alys, they are our family friends and own a textile mill.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Alys said, &#x201c;well, congratulations,&#x201d; and she rose to give her a hug, even as her heart sank. Girls from illustrious feudal families like sixteen-ï¿½year-ï¿½old Tahira married early, started families without delay, and had grandchildren of their own before they knew it. It was a lucky few who went to college while the rest got married, for this was the Tao of obedient girls in Dilipabad; Alys went so far as to say the Tao of good girls in Pakistan.<br><br>Yet it always upset her that young brilliant minds, instead of exploring the universe, were busy chiseling themselves to fit into the molds of Mrs. and Mom. It wasn&#x2019;t that she was averse to Mrs. Mom, only that none of the girls seemed to have ever considered traveling the world by themselves, let alone been encouraged to do so, or to shatter a glass ceiling, or laugh like a madwoman in public without a care for how it looked. At some point over the years, she&#x2019;d made it her job to inject (or as some, like Rose-ï¿½Nama&#x2019;s mother, would say, &#x201c;infect&#x201d;) her students with possibility. And even if the girls in this small sleepy town refused to wake up, wasn&#x2019;t it her duty to try? How grateful she&#x2019;d have been for such a teacher. Instead, she and her sisters had also been raised under their mother&#x2019;s motto to marry young and well, an expectation neither thirty-ï¿½year-ï¿½old Alys, nor her elder sister, thirty-ï¿½two-ï¿½year-ï¿½old Jena, had fulfilled.<br><br>In the year 2000, in the lovely town of Dilipabad, in the lovelier state of Punjab, women like Alys and Jena were, as far as their countrymen and -ï¿½women were concerned, certified Miss Havishams, Charles Dickens&#x2019;s famous spinster who&#x2019;d wasted away her life. Actually, Alys and Jena were considered even worse off, for they had not enjoyed Miss Havisham&#x2019;s good luck of having at least once been engaged.<br><br>As Alys watched, the class swarmed around Tahira, wishing out loud that they too would be blessed with such a ring and begin their real lives.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, girls,&#x201d; she finally said. &#x201c;Settle down. You can ogle the diamond after class. Tahira, you too. I hope you did your homework? Can you share your sentence on the board?&#x201d;<br><br>Tahira began writing with an orange chalk, her ring flashing like a big bright light bulb at the blackboard&#x2014;ï¿½exactly the sort of ring, Alys knew, her own mother coveted for her daughters.<br><br>It is a truth universally acknowledged in this world and beyond that having an ignorant mother is worse than having no mother at all.<br><br>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; Tahira said, carefully wiping chalk dust off her hands. &#x201c;Is that okay, Miss?&#x201d;<br><br>Alys smiled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an opinion.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s rude and disrespectful,&#x201d; Rose-ï¿½Nama called out. &#x201c;Parents can never be ignorant.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What does ignorant mean in this case, do you think?&#x201d; Alys said. &#x201c;At what age might one&#x2019;s own experiences outweigh a parent&#x2019;s?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Never,&#x201d; Rose-ï¿½Nama said frostily. &#x201c;Miss Alys, parents will always have more experience and know what is best for us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Alys said, &#x201c;we&#x2019;ll see in Pride and Prejudice how the main character and her mother start out with similiar views, and where and why they begin to separate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Miss Alys,&#x201d; Tahira said, sliding into her seat, &#x201c;my mother said I won&#x2019;t be attending school after my marriage, so I was wondering, do I still have to do assign&#x2014;ï¿½&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Alys calmly cut her off, having heard this too many times. &#x201c;I expect you to complete each and every assignment, and I also urge you to request that your parents and fiancï¿½, and your mother-ï¿½in-ï¿½law, allow you to finish high school.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to,&#x201d; Tahira said a little wistfully. &#x201c;But my mother says there are more important things than fractions and ABCs.&#x201d;<br><br>Alys would have offered to speak to the girl&#x2019;s mother, but she knew from previous experiences that her recommendation carried no weight. An unmarried woman advocating pursuits outside the home might as well be a witch spreading anarchy and licentiousness.<br><br>&#x201c;Just remember,&#x201d; Alys said quietly, &#x201c;there is more to life than getting married and having children.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But, Miss,&#x201d; Tahira said hesitantly, &#x201c;what&#x2019;s the purpose of life without children?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The same purpose as there would be with children&#x2014;ï¿½to be a good human being and contribute to society. Look, plenty of women physically unable to have children still live perfectly meaningful lives, and there are as many women who remain childless by choice.&#x201d;<br><br>Rose-ï¿½Nama glared. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s just wrong.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not wrong,&#x201d; Alys said gently. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s relative. Not every woman wants to keep home and hearth, and I&#x2019;m sure not every man wants to be the breadwinner.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What does he want to do, then?&#x201d; Rose-ï¿½Nama said. &#x201c;Knit?&#x201d;<br><br>Alys painstakingly removed a fraying silver thread from her black shawl. Finally she said, in an even tone, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll all be pleased to see that there are plenty of marriages in Pride and Prejudice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why do you like the book so much, then?&#x201d; Rose-ï¿½Nama asked disdainfully.<br><br>&#x201c;Because,&#x201d; Alys said simply, &#x201c;Jane Austen is ruthless when it comes to drawing-ï¿½room hypocrisy. She&#x2019;s blunt, impolite, funny, and absolutely honest. She&#x2019;s Jane Khala, one of those honorary good aunts who tells it straight and looks out for you.&#x201d;<br><br>Alys erased the blackboard and wrote, Elizabeth Bennet: First Impressions?, then turned to lead the discussion among the already buzzing girls. None of them had previously read Pride and Prejudice, but many had watched the 1995 BBC drama and were swooning over the scene in which Mr. Darcy emerged from the lake on his Pemberley property in a wet white shirt. She informed them that this particular scene was not in the novel and that, in Austen&#x2019;s time, men actually swam naked. The girls burst into nervous giggles.<br><br>&#x201c;Miss,&#x201d; a few of the girls, giddy, emboldened, piped up, &#x201c;when are you getting married?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Never.&#x201d; Alys had been wondering when this class would finally get around to broaching the topic.<br><br>&#x201c;But why not!&#x201d; several distressed voices cried out. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not that old.

When the researcher seeks to estimate group differences through the use of independent variables that are qualitative, dummy variables allow the researcher to represent information about group membership in quantitative terms without imposing unrealistic measurement assumptions on the categorical variables. Beginning with the simplest model, Hardy probes the use of dummy variable regression in increasingly complex specifications, exploring issues such as: interaction, heteroscedasticity, multiple comparisons and significance testing, the use of effects or contrast coding, testing for curvilinearity, and estimating a piecewise linear regression. </p></p><p>RESEARCH aND TEACHING INTERESTS Quantitative Analysis Techniques, Longitudinal Methods; Aging &amp; Social Change; Public Policy and Aging.

While the basic protocols have changed little, new options such as Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet have increased the complexity of the topic.<br><br>Ethernet has been the flavor of choice for networking administrators since the early 1980s because of its ease of use and scalability. Written by one of the foremost experts on Ethernet standards and configuration, Charles E. Spurgeon, <i>Ethernet: The Definitive Guide</i> includes everything you need to know to set up and maintain an Ethernet network. <br><br><i>Ethernet: The Definitive Guide</i> teaches you everything you need to know about the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard and its protocols. The book is logically separated into five parts:</p><p></p><ul><li><b>Introduction to Ethernet</b> provides a tour of basic Ethernet theory and operation, including a description of Ethernet frames, operation of the Media Access Control (MAC) protocol, full-duplex mode and auto-negotiation.</li><li><b>Ethernet Media Systems</b> is the heart of the book. This sectionof <i>Ethernet: The Definitive Guide</i> shows you how to build media-specific Ethernet networks, from a basic 10BASE-T Ethernet offering 10 Mbps over twisted-pair cables, to an advanced 1000BASE-X Gigabit Ethernet, providing up to 1 Gbps of data transfer over fiber optic cables.</li><li><b>Building Your Ethernet System</b> teaches you how to build twisted-pair and fiber optic media segments, as well as how to build your Ethernet using repeaters and hubs.</li><li><b>Performance and Troubleshooting</b> is divided into two chapters. The first describes both the performance of a given Ethernet channel, as well as the performance of the entire network system. The second includes a tutorial on troubleshooting techniques and describes the kinds of problems network administrators are likely to encounter.</li></ul><p><br><br>The last part of the book includes a complete glossary of terms used throughout the book, a resource list, descriptions of thick and thin coax-based Ethernet systems, a guide to AUI equipment installation and configuration, and a listing of troubleshooting numbers.<br><br>This book is the definitive guide for anyone wanting to build a scalable local area network (LAN) using Ethernet.</p></p><p>The "Ethernet"--as distinct from the Internet, intranet, sneakernet, and others in the net family--is both a familiar face and a familiar name. However, it evokes the mental experience of the school crossing guard whose ownership of a corner of your mindscape is so context-sensitive that a change in venue renders the name or face placeless. Crossing guard or letter carrier? Just what is the Ethernet, again? True to his subject's infrastructural centrality and steadfast obscurity, Charles E. Spurgeon delivers a solid, basic treatise, <i>Ethernet: The Definitive Guide</i>, which describes its subject matter in all of its mundane glory. Appropriately, this is the octopus book from O'Reilly.<p> Spurgeon's examination of Ethernet spans four sections with 20 chapters, three appendices, an 18-page glossary of acronyms and jargon, and a generous index. The Ethernet is the hardware of the Inter/intranet and the underlying packet-formatting software protocols that control the hardware interfaces. But it is mostly just hardware: cables (thin-coaxial, thick, twisted pair, fiber optical), connectors (BNC, RJ-45), hubs (switching, routing), and system catch-all naming conventions (10BASE-2, 10BASE-T.) Sensibly, the discussion excludes Ethernet cards and network communications protocols that are more detailed than frame or packet definition, viz., there is essentially no information on packet-level security. But if you need a plan for designing a telephone closet, Spurgeon waxes eloquent on both network topologies and impedance matching.</p><p> Spurgeon's survey of the Ethernet is enriched by his intimate knowledge of its historical and developmental context. He glances through the original 1970s papers by Metcalfe in which the Ethernet was parameterized as well as the unfortunate misunderstanding of Metcalfe's simple model of throughput, and the subsequent papers that tracked performance characteristics and corrected misunderstandings.</p><p> Since Spurgeon's book is aimed at the network practitioner, his discussions answer engineering questions: How do you design a network? How do the pieces perform? How does it all go together? How do you know what broke? The book is copiously and clearly illustrated with conceptual figures, pin-out diagrams, performance charts, and some basic printouts from network diagnostic applications. There is no network monitoring code whatsoever. Clearly it is best not to mix up the network designer with the programmer, just as the school crossing guard really isn't the letter carrier. But you have to remember to remember that. <i>--Peter Leopold</i></p><p>Charles Spurgeon is a senior technology architect at the University of Texas at Austin, where he works on a campus network system serving over 70,000 users in 200 buildings on two campuses.

I ve had trouble with the more advanced tenses in Spanish until I read this section. The descriptions of each tense are the clearest and most easily understood of any Spanish book that I ve come across. I know some of you have heard Screw Grammar! from my friend Ramses, and to some extent I agree, but I think you still need to know when and how to use your verb tenses. You don t need to memorize the rules but you do need read about them, and more importantly study sentences in your SRS that demonstrate these rules. This book has enough example sentences for each of the verb tenses that you will learn how to use them well.<br>This book also does an excellent job of explaining many of the exceptions that you must deal with in Spanish, and identifies the patterns you will see with irregular verbs, as well as the cases where there is no pattern, like that fui/fuiste/fue/fuimos/fueron can be either ser or ir, which I did not know before. I can honestly say that my Spanish has improved a lot just because of this section of the book. <br><br>The 601 Verbs<br><br>The bulk of this book is the reference section for the 601 verbs. This section is neatly laid out, with one verb per page. The verb s infinitive form and meaning in English are at the top of the page with all the possible conjugations laid out in charts neatly over the rest of the page. The charts are very easy to read, with the suffix changes for each conjugation in bold. Some verbs in this section are highlighted as must know verbs. <br><br>Other sections<br><br>...There is a section on text message abbreviations in Spanish. This is an interesting section, and maybe useful to those of you who text message with Spanish speakers.

Written at the turn of the twentieth century by a distinguished physician, its concepts of health and healing are still ahead of our time. Dr. Kent summarizes, interprets, and systematizes the traditions of homeopathy, offering insights into the essential characteristics of the healing process: how to take a case history, how to study the case, how to establish the hierarchy of symptoms in determining the appropriate remedy--and above all, how to decide what to do after the first prescription, how to interpret the many reactions to therapy, and how to achieve a scientific understanding of a cure.........</p><p>James Tyler Kent, A.M., Chicago, Illinois, Professor of Materia Medica in Hahnemann Medical College, Chicago physician and author of several valuable medical works, is a native of the town of Woodhull, Steuben county, New York, born in 1849, son of Stephen Kent and Caroline Tyler, his wife. His elementary and secondary education was acquired in Franklin Academy, Prattsburg, and his higher education in Madison (now Colgate) University, Hamilton, New York, where he came to his degree, Ph.B., in 1868; A. M., 1870. He was educated in medicine in the Eclectic Medical Institute, Cincinnati, Ohio, graduating there in 1871, and the Homoeopathic Medical College of Missouri, St. Louis, where he was awarded the diploma of that institution in 1889. Dr. Kent began his professional career in St. Louis as a physician of the eclectic school at the same time being actively connected with several eclectic journals in the capacity of writer and also took an earnest part in the councils of the Eclectic National College, St. Louis, 1877-78, about which time his attention was forcibly directed to homoeopathy, through the serious illness of his wife, whose case refused to yield to the treatment either of his own eclectic or the allopathic school practitioners, but was subdued by homoeopathic treatment. He then became a careful student of Hahnemann's Organon and other works of the new school, with result in his complete conversion to homoeopathy, his resignation from the Eclectic Medical Association in 1879 and his appointment to the chair of Anatomy in the Homoeopathic Medical College of Missouri, which he held from 1881 until 1883, and Professor of Materia Medica from 1883 until 1888. Later on he was dean and professor of Materia Medica in the Post-Graduate School of Homoeopathics, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; dean and professor of materia medica in Dunham Medical College, Chicago; dean and professor of materia medica in Hering Medical College, Chicago; and in 1905 he held the same chair in Hahnemann Medical College, Chicago. Thus for more than thirty-five years Dr. Kent had been a conspicuous figure in medical circles, and for more than twenty-five years in teaching and practice under the law of similia; and he is looked upon as one of the ablest teachers and exponents of the homoeoapthic school in America. His contributions to the literature of the profession are known by their strength rather than their length, and include, more prominently, his "Repertory", "Homoeoapthic Philosophy" and "Lectures on Materia Medica". Among the various professional associations of which he was a member, the more prominent of them, were the Illinois State Homoeopathic Medical Society, the American Institute of Homoeopathy and the International Hahnemannian Association, besides which he held a honorary corresponding membership in the British Homoeopathic Medical Society. <p>Kent died, on June 6, 1916 at Stevensville, Montana.<br> -Reprinted from Lectures on Homeopathic Materia Medica</p></p><h2>A History of War in 100 Battles</h2><p>Their very names--Gettysburg, Waterloo, Stalingrad--evoke images of great triumph and equally great suffering, moments when history seemed to hang in the balance. Considered in relation to each other, such battles--and others of less immediate renown--offer insight into the changing nature of armed combat, advances in technology, shifts in strategy and thought, as well as altered geopolitical landscapes. The most significant military engagements in history define the very nature of war. <br><br>In his newest book, Richard Overy plumbs over 3,000 years of history, from the Fall of Troy in 1200 BC to the Fall of Baghdad in 2003, to locate the 100 battles that he believes the most momentous. Arranged by themes such as leadership, innovation, deception, and courage under fire, Overy presents engaging essays on each battle that together provide a rich picture of how combat has changed through the ages, as well as highlighting what has remained consistent despite advances in technology. <br><br>The battles covered here offer a wide geographic sweep, from ancient Greece to China, Constantinople to Moscow, North to South America, providing a picture of the dominant empires across time and context for comparison between various military cultures. From familiar engagements like Thermopylae (480 BC), Verdun (1916), and the Tet Offensive (1968) to lesser-studied battles such as Zama (202 BC), Arsuf (1191), and Navarino Bay (1827), Overy presents the key actors, choices, and contingencies, focusing on those details--sometimes overlooked--that decided the battle. The American victory at the Battle of Midway, for example, was determined by only ten bombs. It was, as Wellington said of Waterloo, a "near run thing." <br><br>Rather than focusing on the question of victory or defeat, Overy examines what an engagement can tell us on a larger level about the history of warfare itself. New weapons and tactics can have a sudden impact on the outcome of a battle--but so too can leadership, or the effects of a clever deception, or raw courage. Overy offers a deft and visually captivating look at the engagements that have shaped the course of human history, and changed the face of warfare.<br></p><p><br><strong>Richard Overy</strong> is Professor of History at the University of Exeter. In 2001 he was awarded the Samuel Eliot Morison Prize of the Society for Military History for his contribution to the history of warfare. He has published over twenty books on the subject, including<em> Russia's War: A History of the</em> <em>Soviet Effort: 1941-1945</em> and <em>Why the Allies Won</em>.<br>Praise for `The Times Complete History of the World&#39;:`One of the great works of historical reference in the English language.

After gaining exclusive access to the writer's archives, he wrote a two-part, award-winning biography, <i>Vladimir Nabokov: The Russian Years</i> (1990) and <i>Vladimir Nabokov: The American Years</i> (1991). This collection features essays written by Boyd since completing the biography, incorporating material he gleaned from his research as well as new discoveries and formulations.<br><br>Boyd confronts Nabokov's life, career, and legacy; his art, science, and thought; his subtle humor and puzzle-like storytelling; his complex psychological portraits; and his inheritance from, reworking of, and affinities with Shakespeare, Pushkin, Tolstoy, and Machado de Assis. Boyd offers new ways of reading Nabokov's best English-language works: <i>Lolita</i>, <i>Pale Fire</i>, <i>Ada</i>, and the unparalleled autobiography, <i>Speak, Memory</i>, and he discloses otherwise unknown information about the author's world. Sharing his personal reflections, Boyd recounts the adventures, hardships, and revelations of researching Nabokov's biography and his unusual finds in the archives, including materials still awaiting publication. The first to focus on Nabokov's metaphysics, Boyd cautions against their being used as the key to unlock all of the author's secrets, showing instead the many other rooms in Nabokov's castle of fiction that need exploring, such as his humor, narrative invention, and psychological insight into characters and readers alike. Appreciating Nabokov as novelist, memoirist, poet, translator, scientist, and individual, Boyd helps us understand more than ever the author's multifaceted genius.</p><p>In this book, Brian Boyd surveys Vladimir Nabokov's life, career, and legacy; his art, science, and thought; his subtle humor and puzzle-like storytelling; his complex psychological portraits; and his inheritance from, reworking of, and affinities with Shakespeare, Pushkin, Tolstoy, and Machado de Assis.

With this provocative and apparently paradoxical claim, Steven Shapin begins his bold vibrant exploration of the origins of the modern scientific worldview.<br> <br> "Shapin's account is informed, nuanced, and articulated with clarity. . . . This is not to attack or devalue science but to reveal its richness as the human endeavor that it most surely is. . . .Shapin's book is an impressive achievement."&#x2014;David C. Lindberg, <i>Science</i><br> <br> "Shapin has used the crucial 17th century as a platform for presenting the power of science-studies approaches. At the same time, he has presented the period in fresh perspective."&#x2014;<i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i><br> <br> "Timely and highly readable . . . A book which every scientist curious about our predecessors should read."&#x2014;Trevor Pinch, <i>New Scientist</i><br> <br> "It's hard to believe that there could be a more accessible, informed or concise account of how it [the scientific revolution], and we have come to this. <i>The Scientific Revolution</i> should be a set text in all the disciplines. And in all the indisciplines, too."&#x2014;Adam Phillips, <i>London Review of Books</i><br> <br> "Shapin's treatise on the currents that engendered modern science is a combination of history and philosophy of science for the interested and educated layperson."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br> <br> "Superlative, accessible, and engaging. . . . Absolute must-reading."&#x2014;Robert S. Frey, <i>Bridges</i><br> <br> "This vibrant historical exploration of the origins of modern science argues that in the 1600s science emerged from a variety of beliefs, practices, and influences. . . . This history reminds us that diversity is part of any intellectual endeavor."&#x2014;<i>Choice</i><br> <br> "Most readers will conclude that there was indeed something dramatic enough to be called the Scientific Revolution going on, and that this is an excellent book about it."&#x2014;Anthony Gottlieb, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br></p></p><p>In the last ten years, a new school of sociology has grown up that sees science as not only relativistic but as a purely human construct; that ties scientists&#39; findings about &#34;nature&#34; to their standing in the cultural and political milieu of which they are a part. Steven Shapin adds to this revisionist literature with a fascinating, paradoxical book that at once questions our notions of the scientific revolution of the last century and deepens our understanding of it. Shapin examines four themes in the history of modern science: mechanism (the idea of nature as a machine); objectivism; methodology and impartiality; and altruism (the idea that science can better the lot of mankind). He does so in three deft, incisive sections: &#34;What Was Known?&#34;; &#34;How Was It Known?&#34;; and &#34;What Was the Knowledge For?&#34; This excellent study, written for the layman, explains how the scientists&#39; world shaped their knowledge of the natural world.Rejecting the notion that there is anything like an &#34;essence&#34; of early modern science, Shapin emphasizes the social practices by which scientific knowledge was produced and the social purposes for which it was intended. He shows how the conduct of science emerged from a wide array of early modern philosophical agendas, political commitments, and religious beliefs. And he treats science not as a set of disembodied ideas, but as historically situated ways of knowing and doing. Shapin argues against traditional views that represent the Scientific Revolution as a coherent, cataclysmic, and once-and-for-all event. Every tendency that has customarily been identified as its modernizing essence was contested by sixteenth- and seventeenth-century practitioners with equal claims to modernity. Experimentalism was both advocated and rejected; mathematical methods were both celebrated and treated with skepticism; mechanical conceptions of nature were seen both as defining proper science and as limited in their intelligibility and application; and the role of experience in making scientific knowledge was treated in radically different ways. Yet Shapin points to the many ways that contested legacy is nevertheless rightly understood as the origin of modern science, its problems as well as its acknowledged achievements.</p><h2>Prescriptions for Happiness</h2><p>Happiness is a state of mind, and in this popular book, Ken Keyes teaches the reader three steps to use in creating happiness.

We need to be at home in our bodies, too--not in the &#39;useless, weak&#39; husks that we drag daily to the fluorescently cheerful &#39;health club, &#39; but a body that each day knows the &#39;elemental pleasures of eating and drinking and resting, of being dry while it is raining, of getting dry after getting wet, of getting warm after getting cold, of cooling off after getting hot.&#39; Of being tired at sundown and at life&#39;s end feeling a great weariness ... like the lesser weariness that comes with day&#39;s end--a weariness that had been earned and was therefore accepted.&#34;</p><h2>Illustrated Shakespeare: Merchant of Venice</h2><p>An illustrated gift edition of one of the bard&#39;s most famous plays is handsomely bound with illustrated endpapers, a ribbon marker, and a three-piece case and includes sixteen color illustrations and black-and-white drawings.</p><p>The Merchant of Venice has been performed more often than any other comedy by Shakespeare.

Rob Fuquay is senior pastor at St. Luke&#39;s United Methodist Church in Indianapolis, IN. As a pastor to one of the largest churches in the denomination, Rob says as he studies Jesus, he sees someone who shows grace to all people, and he wants to be a part of a church that models that understanding. Fuquay has degrees from Pfeiffer University and Candler School of Theology at Emory University. He and his wife, Susan, have three daughters Julie, Sarah, and Anna. Rob is the best-selling author of *The God We Can Know: Exploring the &#34;I Am&#34; Statements of Jesus**.Rob Fuquay's <i>Which Way, Lord?</i> is first and foremost a book of encouragement for those who actively seek a purpose and meaningful direction in life as Christians. It is also a delightfully painless way to learn about the life of Paul, his conversion, his careful listening to Christ before beginning ministry, three missionary trips, and all the challenges Paul faced in being obedient to Christ until the end of his life. Fuquay's writing is informed by scholarship and at the same time user-friendly with its down-to-earth approach. His humor and use of real-life stories, "servant spotlight" testimonies, make for an engaging read. I commend this book for anyone interested in a deepened understanding of and commitment to following the ways of Jesus. --Lallene J.

Yet in our world of nights as bright as day, most of us no longer experience true darkness. Eight out of ten Americans born today won't ever live where they can see the Milky Way. And exposure to artificial light at night has been cited as a factor in health concerns ranging from poor sleep to cancer.<br><br>In his gorgeous debut, THE END OF NIGHT, Paul Bogard travels the globe to find the night, blending personal narrative, natural history, health, science, and folklore to shed light on darkness. Showing exactly what we've lost, what we have left, and what we might hope to regain, he attempts nothing less than a restoration of how we see the spectacularly primal, wildly dark night sky.</p><p>Paul Bogard teaches creative nonfiction at James Madison University.

Clive Emsley addresses all the major issues of debate; he explores the impact of legislation and policy at both national and local levels, and considers the claim that the English police were non-political and free from political control. In the final section, he looks at the changing experience of police life. Established as a standard introduction to the subject on its first appearance, the Second Edition has been substantially revised and is now published under the Longman imprint for the first time.<br></p><p><p>"This broad and comprehensive coverage of the history of the English police that includes its prehistory and takes us up to the present is set to become the new standard text. ... Within the historiography, Emsley places himself halfway between the traditionalists' account of progress enacted by far-seeing reformers and the radicals who regarded police legislation and powers as enactments in the interests of the ruling class. His book, he declares, is an attempt by a 'woolly liberal' to write a history of the police critical of the traditional Whig view but equally sceptical of the idea that the police can best be regarded as an instrument of class power. In this aim he succeeds admirably... Here is a historian whose knowledge of English policing history over the whole of the period is second to none."<br> <br>So wrote Barbara Weinberger in the British Journal of Criminology of this distinguished book - the first comprehensive history of the origins and development of the police in England since the subject first began to be explored seriously by historians in the 1970s. Much of it is based on the rich and still largely unexplored archives which remain in police hands.<br> <br>The bulk of the book charts the development of the modern police force chronologically, and considers policing from above. It explores the impact of legislation and political action on policing at both national and local levels, and investigates the claim that the English police were non-political and never subject to political control. In his final section, however, Clive Emsley examines policing from below, looking at the changing experience of police work and police life since the early nineteenth century. He discusses what kind of people joined police forces over the years, what their tasks were, and how successfully they achieved them. The book concludes with a discussion of what - if anything - distinguishes the English bobby from his European and North American counterparts.<br> <br>This welcome Second Edition offers The English Police in paperback, and under the Longman imprint, for the first time. The text has been fully revised to take account of recent scholarship; the story has been updated to the end of 1995; and there is valuable statistical material in a new appendix. <br> <br>"readable, well-informed and up-to-date... it supplements, and in many areas will replace, T.A.Critchley's History of Police in England and Wales as the standard text." <br>Stanley H. Palmer, Albion<br> <br>"This is a scrupulously fair and well-reasoned account, enlivened and strengthened by Emsley's research on may local forces, his interviews with retired policemen, and his knowledge of the national and international context of police history. It will be welcomed and enjoyed by students, teachers and woolly liberals everywhere." <br>Stephen Inwood, London Journal<br>____________________________________________________________________________<br>CLIVE EMSLEY is Professor of History at the Open University and President of the International Association for the History of Crime and Criminal Justice.<br> </p><strong>Clive Emsley</strong>&nbsp; is Professor of History at the Open University and President of the International Association for the HIstory of Crime and Criminal Justice.</p><h2>Carson Dellosa Bilingual Spanish Sight Words Flash Cards Kindergarten, Spanish And English Flash Cards With Basic Sight Word Vocabulary For Kindergarten, 1st Grade, Spanish Games Ages 5+ (54 Cards)</h2><p>The Bilingual Sight Words Flash Cards for ages 5+ are a great starter Spanish set for any beginner.

A farm is taken over by its overworked, mistreated animals. With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. First published during the epoch of Stalinist Russia, today it is clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, and under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of Orwell&#39;s masterpiece is a message still ferociously fresh.</p><p>Since its publication in 1946, George Orwell's fable of a workers' revolution gone wrong has been recognized as a classic of modern political satire. Fuelled by Orwell's intense disillusionment with Soviet Communism, <i>Animal Farm</i> is a nearly perfect piece of writing--both an engaging story and an allegory that actually works. When the downtrodden beasts of Manor Farm oust their drunken human master and take over management of the land, all are awash in collectivist zeal. Everyone willingly works overtime, productivity soars and for one brief, glorious season, every belly is full. The animals' Seven Commandment credo is painted in big white letters on the barn. All animals are equal. No animal shall drink alcohol, wear clothes, sleep in a bed or kill a fellow four-footed creature. Those that go upon four legs or wings are friends and the two-legged are, by definition, the enemy. Too soon, however, the pigs, who have styled themselves leaders by virtue of their intelligence, succumb to the temptations of privilege and power. "We pigs are brainworkers. The whole management and organisation of the farm depend on us. Day and night, we are watching over your welfare. It is for your sake that we drink that milk and eat those apples." While this swinish brotherhood sells out the revolution, cynically editing the Seven Commandments to excuse their violence and greed, the common animals are once again left hungry and exhausted, no better off than in the days when humans ran the farm. Satire <i>Animal Farm</i> may be, but it's a stony reader who remains unmoved when the stalwart workhorse, Boxer, having given his all to his comrades, is sold to the glue factory to buy booze for the pigs. Orwell's view of Communism is bleak indeed, but given the history of the Russian people since 1917, his pessimism has an air of prophecy. --<i>Joyce Thompson</i>`Brilliant&#39;. --Daily Mail</p><h2>Women Design: Pioneers in architecture, industrial, graphic and digital design from the twentieth century to the present day</h2><p><p>From architects and product designers to textile&nbsp;artists and digital innovators,&nbsp;<i>Women Design</i>&nbsp;profiles a selection of the most dynamic female designers&nbsp;from the modern era,&nbsp;showcasing their finest work and celebrating&nbsp;their enduring influence.<br><br> Design throughout history has been profoundly&nbsp;shaped and enhanced by the creativity of women;&nbsp;as practitioners, commentators, educators and commissioners.&nbsp;But in a narrative&nbsp;that eagerly promotes&nbsp;their male counterparts, their contributions&nbsp;are all&nbsp;too often overlooked.

With his help hundreds of people of all ages have learned to play clarinet, sax, transverse flute, Native American Flute, Jazz and Classical piano. His friendship with the Native American Flute began in 1995 when he heard the sound. As an educator he realized how easy it was for almost anyone to play. Unlike piano or guitar that take years of study, this instrument could be mastered in a short time. What followed was his initiation of Flute classes at Scottsdale Community College in Scottsdale, Arizona and the first 16 week credited program for Native American Flute on a Community College level In February 2005, his 2nd book Song for Koko:Jazz for Native American Flute was presented for the advanced player. NOW here is Volume II of the Native American FLute SONGBOOK based on all you learned in Volume IUnderstanding the Gift by John Vames - best book on the planet for learning to play Native American Flute. I have tried and carried numerous other method books and have decided to carry this Book exclusively. There is none better in my opinion. If you are looking for lessons that you can see, hear and understand, this is the resource for you. You learn everything from proper finger placement, breathing, embellishments, and vibrato (the techniques to create those wonderful sounds you hear the best artists use). John explains and plays these techniques on the accompanying CD perfectly. You will also learn improvisation and you have the opportunity to learn and understand how to read Tablature for NAF. John makes everything perfectly clear in the book and on the accompanying CD. Tap into the knowledge and 40 + years of experience of a master musician and instructor. You will not find a better Book to learn the Native American Flute with. **Once you have taken advantage of John's teaching acumen and have become proficient with the NAF, I highly recommend Song For Koko:JAZZ also by John. This resource will further reveal to you the art of improvisation (which is the essence of the NAF) using Jazz as the vehicle to further your performance skills. Do yourself a favor and pick up these Books today. You will be pleased with the results, and so will your audience. ; Richard Maynard, Flutemaker LAUGHING CROW FLUTES --Richard Maynard, Flutemaker Laughing Crow FLutes --Richard Maynard Laughing Crow Flutes<br><br>This is the missing piece of work that the NAF community needed...this is the first system/book/cd --sound out, quite literally, potential mates, is now used Bob Bellus Sweet River Sounds<br><br><br>;Native American flute music has become an important aspect of the New Age and World music genres. What was once used by young warriors to sound out, quite literally, potential mates, is now used to produce haunting musical albums. In the past, many of the flute; manuals were written by musicians with little or no formal European music training. This manual closes that gap as the author, a highly experienced music educator, explains the instrument in both Native American terms and notation systems, as well as Western music theory analysis. It does a great job of explaining an almost mystical primitive musical instrument and system in a way that all cultures will understand. The accompanying audio CD is an absolutely necessary teaching aid which aptly demonstrates each lesson line upon line, precept upon precept. We rated this manual and CD a high four hearts. Bob Spear Publisher &amp; Chief Reviewer HEARTLAND REVIEWS Leavenworth Kansas -- --Bob Spear Publisher Heartland Reviews</p><h2>Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</h2><p>Critical Praise...<br> <br> "In my interviews with over 30 of the best traders of our time,there were some questions that I raised in each conversation. Oneof these was: Are there any books that you found particularlyvaluable and would recommend to aspiring traders? By far, the mostfrequent response was Reminiscences of a Stock Operator-a book thatwas over 70 years old!"<br> --from the Foreword by Jack Schwager, author ofMarket Wizards and The New Market Wizards<br> <br> "Although Reminiscences.was first published some 70 years ago,its take on crowd psychology and market timing is as timely as lastsummer's frenzy on the foreign exchange markets."<br> --Worth magazine<br> <br> "The most entertaining book written on investing isReminiscences of a Stock Operator, by Edwin Lefevre, firstpublished in 1923."<br> --The Seattle Times<br> <br> "The best book I've read is Reminiscences of a StockOperator. I keep a supply for people who come to work forme."<br> --Martin Zweig<br> <br> "After 20 years and many re-reads, Reminiscences is still one ofmy all-time favorites."<br> --Kenneth L. Fisher<br> <br> Forbes First published in 1923, Reminiscences of a StockOperator is the fictionalized biography of Jesse Livermore, oneof the greatest speculators ever. Reminiscences remains the mostwidely read, highly recommended investment book ever written.Generations of investors have found that it has more to teach themabout themselves and other investors than years of experience inthe market. This is a timeless tale that will enrich the lives-andportfolios-of today's investors as it has those of generationspast.</p><p>Stock investing is a relatively recent phenomenon and the inventory of true classics is somewhat slim. When asked, people in the know will always list books by Benjamin Graham, Burton G. Malkiel's <i>A Random Walk Down Wall Street</i>, and <i>Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits and Other Writings</i> by Philip A. Fisher. You'll know you're getting really good advice if they also mention <i>Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</i> by Edwin Lefï¿½vre. <p> <i>Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</i> is the thinly disguised biography of Jesse Livermore, a remarkable character who first started speculating in New England bucket shops at the turn of the century. Livermore, who was banned from these shady operations because of his winning ways, soon moved to Wall Street where he made and lost his fortune several times over. What makes this book so valuable are the observations that Lefï¿½vre records about investing, speculating, and the nature of the market itself. For example: </p><p> "It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting. Got that? My sitting tight! It is no trick at all to be right on the market. You always find lots of early bulls in bull markets and early bears in bear markets. I've known many men who were right at exactly the right time, and began buying or selling stocks when prices were at the very level which should show the greatest profit. And their experience invariably matched mine--that is, they made no real money out of it. Men who can both be right and sit tight are uncommon."</p><p> If you've ever spent weekends and nights puzzling over whether to buy, sell, or hold a position in whatever investment--be it stock, bonds, or pork bellies, you'll be glad that you read this book. <i>Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</i> is full of lessons that are as relevant today as they were in 1923 when the book was first published. Highly recommended. <i>--Harry C. Edwards</i></p><b><i>Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</i></b> <p>"... I learned early that there is nothing new in Wall Street. There can't be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again. I've never forgotten that.... The fact that I remember that way is my way of capitalizing experience."<br> --<b>from Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</b></p> <p>First published in 1923, <i>Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</i> is the fictionalized biography of Jesse Livermore, one of the greatest speculators who ever lived. Now, more than 70 years later, Reminiscences remains the most widely read, highly recommended investment book ever written. Generations of investors have found that it has more to teach them about themselves and other investors than years of experience in the market. They have also discovered that its trading advice and keen analyses of market price movements ring as true today as in 1923. Jesse Livermore won and lost tens of millions of dollars playing the stock and commodities markets during the early 1900s--at one point making the thenastronomical amount of ten million dollars in just one month of trading. So potent a market force was he in his day that, in 1929, he was widely believed to be the man responsible for causing the Crash. He was forced into seclusion and had to hire a bodyguard. Originally reviewed in The New York Times as a nonfiction book, Reminiscences of a Stock Operator vividly recounts Livermore's mastery of the markets from the age cf 14. Always good at figures, he learns, early on, that he can predict which way the numbers will go. Starting out with an investment of five dollars, he amasses a fortune by his early twenties and establishes himself as a major player on the Street. He makes his first killing in 1906, selling short on Union Pacific. He goes on to corner the cotton market, and has a million-dollar day Bullish in bear markets and bearish among bulls, he claims that only suckers gamble on the market. The trick, he advises, is to protect yourself by balancing your investments, and selling big on the way down. Livermore goes broke three times, but he comes back each time feeling richer for the learning experience. Offering profound insights into the motivations, attitudes, and feelings shared by every investor, Reminiscences of a Stock Operator is a timeless instructional tale that will enrich the lives--and portfolios--of today's traders as it has those of generations past.</p></p><h2>Basics of Web Design: HTML5 &amp; CSS3 (3rd Edition)</h2><p><i>For introductory courses in Web Design.</i> <br><i></i><br><i>Free Student Files Download Available at wps.pearsoned.com/ecs_felke_bwdHTML5_CSS3_3/</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The Fundamentals of Web Development for the New Designer </b> <br> <b> <i>Basics of Web Design: HTML5 &amp; CSS3 </i> </b>is the comprehensive source material for beginners in web design and development.

This blurred and constantly shifting frontier region, known as the backcountry, existed just beyond England's imperial reach on the North American mainland. It became an area of opportunity, intrigue, and conflict for the diverse peoples who lived there.</p><p>In <i>At the Edge of Empire</i>, Eric Hinderaker and Peter C. Mancall describe the nature of the complex interactions among these interests, examining colorful and sometimes gripping instances of familiarity and uneasiness, acceptance and animosity, and cooperation and conflict, from individual encounters to such vast undertakings as the Seven Years' War. Over time, the European settlers who established farms and trading posts in the backcountry displaced the region's Native inhabitants. Warfare and disease each took a horrifying toll across Indian country, making it easier for immigrants to establish themselves on lands once peopled only by Native Americans. Eventually, these pioneers established economically, culturally, and politically self-sufficient communities that increasingly resented London's claims of sovereignty. As Hinderaker and Mancall show, these resentments helped to shape the ideals that guided the colonists during the American Revolution.</p><p>The first book in a new Johns Hopkins series, Regional Perspectives on Early America, <i>At the Edge of Empire</i> explores one of British America's most intriguing regions, both widening and deepening our understanding of North America's colonial experience.</p></p><p><p><b>Eric Hinderaker </b> is an associate professor of history at the University of Utah and author of <i>Elusive Empires: Constructing Colonialism in the Ohio Valley, 1673-1800</i>. <b>Peter C.

Written for a broad audience by a journalist who has covered the field for twenty years, the book is a lively account of both the people and the ideas behind this revolutionary technology. <br>The basic concept underlying fiber optics was first explored in the 1840s when researchers used jets of water to guide light in laboratory demonstrations. The idea caught the public eye decades later when it was used to create stunning illuminated fountains at many of the great Victorian exhibitions. The modern version of fiber optics--using flexible glass fibers to transmit light--was discovered independently five times through the first half of the century, and one of its first key applications was the endoscope, which for the first time allowed physicians to look inside the body without surgery. Endoscopes became practical in 1956 when a college undergraduate discovered how to make solid glass fibers with a glass cladding. <br>With the invention of the laser, researchers grew interested in optical communications. While Bell Labs and others tried to send laser beams through the atmosphere or hollow light pipes, a small group at Standard Telecommunication Laboratories looked at guiding light by transparent fibers. Led by Charles K. Kao, they proposed the idea of fiber-optic communications and demonstrated that contrary to what many researchers thought glass could be made clear enough to transmit light over great distances. Following these ideas, Corning Glass Works developed the first low-loss glass fibers in 1970. <br>From this point fiber-optic communications developed rapidly. The first experimental phone links were tested on live telephone traffic in 1977 and within half a dozen years long-distance companies were laying fiber cables for their national backbone systems. In 1988, the first transatlantic fiber-optic cable connected Europe with North America, and now fiber optics are the key element in global communications. <br>The story continues today as fiber optics spread through the communication grid that connects homes and offices, creating huge information pipelines and replacing copper wires. The book concludes with a look at some of the exciting potential developments of this technology.<br></p><p>Computers you notice. They sit on your desk and hum, ever smaller, ever faster, and always obsolete if bought longer ago than last week. But the equally impressive technology that turns millions of terminals into a global network is less obvious. The phone line that comes into your house probably still pushes electrons through metal. But not far away, the signal will join millions of others relayed down fiber optic cables by laser. Jeff Hecht's fascinating account of this undersung technology goes back 150 years to find the origins of fiber optics. Then he chronicles the many ingenious and determined engineers who fashioned it into a technology that festoons the globe with cables carrying pulses of photons. It was harder than pioneering copper links because supplanting an existing technology needs more persuasion than establishing the first one. And there was competition from the satellite industry, as well as unexpected setbacks, such as sharks who ignored copper but chewed fiber optic cables. Hecht tells a good tale, combining a light journalistic touch with a scholarly knowledge of the industry he has covered for over two decades. The story is not over yet, but this is a rich account of how we got this far in a technology that really has fueled a revolution. <i>--Jon Turney, Amazon.co.uk</i>Jeff Hecht met his first laser as a Caltech undergraduate in 1968, and took a while to figure out what it was good for. In his case, it was a lot of words--he&#39;s been writing about lasers and optics for the past thirty years.</p><h2>Indonesian Batik: Processes, Patterns, and Places (Images of Asia)</h2><p>This book describes the whole range of batiks of Indonesia: the traditional designs of Central Java as well as those of the north coast of Java, and covers the processes, designs, and regional centers of batik.</p><p></p><h2>Royal Highness (Modern Classics)</h2><p><i>Royal Highness</i> is the delightfully ironic tale of a small, decadent German duchy and its invigoration by the intellect and values of an independent-minded American woman.

In my library <i>Prejudices</i> will stand between the sermons of Jonathan Edwards and the eruptions of Mark Twain. (Kenneth S. Lynn)<br><br>What a bloody wonderful book! What a perfect idea! And the perfect author! My position is that no future book should ever be written on any of the subjects touched. (William F. Buckley, Jr.)<br><br><b>Robert Nisbet</b>&#x2019;s new book I thought extremely good&#x2015;remarkable for its clarity and wit, as perceptive as it is intelligent, a welcome voice of reason in a debate too often given over to pedants and ideologues. (Lewis H. Lapaham)</p><h2>Small Worlds</h2><p><p>Everyone knows the small-world phenomenon: soon after meeting a stranger, we are surprised to discover that we have a mutual friend, or we are connected through a short chain of acquaintances. In his book, Duncan Watts uses this intriguing phenomenon--colloquially called "six degrees of separation"--as a prelude to a more general exploration: under what conditions can a small world arise in any kind of network?</p><br><p> The networks of this story are everywhere: the brain is a network of neurons; organisations are people networks; the global economy is a network of national economies, which are networks of markets, which are in turn networks of interacting producers and consumers. Food webs, ecosystems, and the Internet can all be represented as networks, as can strategies for solving a problem, topics in a conversation, and even words in a language. Many of these networks, the author claims, will turn out to be small worlds.</p><br><p> How do such networks matter? Simply put, local actions can have global consequences, and the relationship between local and global dynamics depends critically on the network's structure. Watts illustrates the subtleties of this relationship using a variety of simple models---the spread of infectious disease through a structured population; the evolution of cooperation in game theory; the computational capacity of cellular automata; and the sychronisation of coupled phase-oscillators.</p><br><p> Watts's novel approach is relevant to many problems that deal with network connectivity and complex systems' behaviour in general: How do diseases (or rumours) spread through social networks? How does cooperation evolve in large groups? How do cascading failures propagate through large power grids, or financial systems? What is the most efficient architecture for an organisation, or for a communications network? This fascinating exploration will be fruitful in a remarkable variety of fields, including physics and mathematics, as well as sociology, economics, and biology.</p></p><p><p>"Duncan Watts has created that rarity of rarities: a book with enough fascinating facts and stories to keep the casual reader turning the pages coupled with enough engaging detail to satisfy the most technically sophisticated reader. Thus, whether you are just curious about the world around you or eager to begin your own small-world research, this is the definitive guide to the fascinating and profound world of small-world networks."--<b>William L. Ditto, Applied Chaos Laboratory, Georgia Institute of Technology</b></p><p>"A good book on a fascinating topic--why two widely separated people are often connected by a small number of steps from friend to friend. We do indeed live in a 'small world.' When something happens so often there must be a reason--Duncan Watts is looking for it."--<b>Gilbert Strang, Department of Mathematics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</b></p><p>"Duncan Watts's and Steve Strogatz's 1998 Nature paper on 'The collective dynamics of small-world networks' reinvigorated interest in the small-world phenomenon. Now, in <i>Small Worlds</i>, Watts follows up on this work with a detailed but accessible account of small-world networks that will appeal to both scientists and nonscientists. With examples ranging from the Kevin Bacon Game to models for the spread of diseases, Watts provides a clear description of how the structure of small-world networks can be characterized and a sense of how the interconnectivity of such networks can lead to intriguing dynamics. Be sure to tell your friends and their friends about this book."--<b>J. J. Collins, Center for BioDynamics and Department of Biomedical Engineering, Boston University</b></p><p>"Enchanting! A voyage of exploration with fascinating byroads that yet brings the reader to powerful and useable conclusions. This work is worthy of Stanley Milgram exactly because Watts goes well beyond the original visualization while retaining its transparency."--<b>Harrison White, Department of Sociology, Columbia University</b></p><p>"If you are a postgraduate looking to make your name or a seasoned researcher looking for new challenges, this book offers something rare: a chance to get in at the ground floor of a whole new area of research whose variety of exciting applications is exceeded only by their abundance."--<b>Robert A. J. Matthews, Aston University, U.K.</b></p><p>"<i>Small Worlds</i> is outstanding. Watts begins with a simple observation: clustered networks, networks characterized by a large fraction of short ties and a small fraction of 'shortcuts' linking clusters with one another, appear in diverse settings and more frequently than might be expected. Watts then demonstrates that the dynamical behavior of these networks is highly sensitive to structure. The book is must reading, although not easy reading, for social scientists interested in networks, decision-making, and organizational design.(In other words, this is a high-investment, high-payoff book.)"--<b>Marshall W. Meyer, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania</b></p><p>"This is a remarkably novel analysis, with implications for a broad range of scientific disciplines, including neurobiology, sociology, ecology, economics, and epidemiology. . . . The results are potentially profoundly important."--<b>Simon A. Levin, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University</b></p><p>"Theoretical research on social networks has been hampered by a lack of models which capture the essential properties of large numbers of graphs with only a few key parameters. All the dyads, triads and acyclic mappings which fill the social network literature lead merely to a long enumeration of special cases. The random graph models introduced by Watts provide a rich foundation for future analytical and empirical research.

But from Pearl Harbor on, he often wrote passionate accounts of America&#x2019;s wars based on his own firsthand experience. Vietnam was no exception.</p><p>Thomas E. Barden&#x2019;s <i>Steinbeck in Vietnam</i> offers for the first time a complete collection of the dispatches Steinbeck wrote as a war correspondent for <i>Newsday.</i> Rejected by the military because of his reputation as a subversive, and reticent to document the war officially for the Johnson administration, Steinbeck saw in <i>Newsday</i> a unique opportunity to put his skills to use. Between December 1966 and May 1967, the sixty-four-year-old Steinbeck toured the major combat areas of South Vietnam and traveled to the north of Thailand and into Laos, documenting his experiences in a series of columns titled Letters to Alicia, in reference to <i>Newsday</i> publisher Harry F. Guggenheim&#x2019;s deceased wife. His columns were controversial, coming at a time when opposition to the conflict was growing and even ardent supporters were beginning to question its course. As he dared to go into the field, rode in helicopter gunships, and even fired artillery pieces, many detractors called him a warmonger and worse. Readers today might be surprised that the celebrated author would risk his literary reputation to document such a divisive war, particularly at the end of his career.</p><p>Drawing on four primary-source archives&#x2015;the Steinbeck collection at Princeton, the Papers of Harry F. Guggenheim at the Library of Congress, the Pierpont Morgan Library&#x2019;s Steinbeck holdings, and the archives of <i>Newsday</i>&#x2015;Barden&#x2019;s collection brings together the last published writings of this American author of enduring national and international stature. In addition to offering a definitive edition of these essays, Barden includes extensive notes as well as an introduction that provides background on the essays themselves, the military situation, the social context of the 1960s, and Steinbeck&#x2019;s personal and political attitudes at the time.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Thomas E. Barden is Professor of English and Dean of the Honors College at the University of Toledo.</p><p>These dispatches are really the last work that Steinbeck published, and they are intensely interesting pieces of writing. Their vividness alone makes them worth reading. The letters are impressionistic, and they often contain excellent reportage, showing readers what the war looked like from the ground. They remind us once again that Steinbeck&#x2019;s gift was essentially journalistic.</p> (Jay Parini, Middlebury College, author of <i>John Steinbeck: A Biography</i>)<br><br><p>[O]pinions that viscerally reflect the deep political chasm that the war created in America. Steinbeck&#x2019;s writing is vividly descriptive, evoking place and circumstance.... [His] ability to capture the day-to-day conduct of the war and its destructive force is sometimes shockingly immediate.</p> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br><p>[Steinbeck's] dispatches reflect his initial excitement over the weaponry (e.g., the AC-47 gunship, known as Puff the Magic Dragon) and the heroic American soldiers standing against communism, but he gradually came to see the mismatch between the American narrative and the reality that most Vietnamese just wanted the war to end. By the time he left Asia, readers can sense disillusion and a feeling that the soldiers were in an unwinnable situation.... This personal look at a contentious moment in American history will supplement Vietnam War collections and reward any student who wishes to better understand the times.</p> (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br><p>Between December 1966 and May 1967, Steinbeck filed pieces that sought to support the U.S. effort in Vietnam, to lionize the soldiers whom he met (and with whom he occasionally ducked incoming rounds), to expose the dimensions of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese violence against civilians, to chide the liberal media for ingesting without question the enemy&#x2019;s propaganda and to urge other writers (he names Updike, Williams, Bellow, Albee and Miller) to travel to Vietnam to see the war firsthand.... Steinbeck&#x2019;s positions later softened, but not in the pages of Newsday.</p> (<i>Kirkus</i>)<br><br><p>Though John Steinbeck is best known for chronicling the woes of the Great Depression, his raw, journalistic accounts of later human tragedies are written with the same poignancy as <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> and <i>Of Mice and Men</i>. In <i>Steinbeck in Vietnam,</i> we are offered glimpses of the author's last works.</p> (<i>Huffington Post</i>)<br><br><p>Reading <i>Steinbeck in Vietnam</i> is a fascinating, occasionally uncomfortable experience.... Written with the force that characterizes all of Steinbeck's work, his Vietnam dispatches are a mixture of vitriolic attacks on war protestors, lyrical descriptions of the countryside, paeans to the American soldier and moments of stunning insight. What makes the columns more than a historical curiosity is Steinbeck's effort to understand the war on its own terms. That internal struggle, publicly shared in the pages of Newsday, is as powerful an evocation of the Vietnam experience as Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried.</p><p>Literary scholar Thomas E. Barden's editorial touch is light and clearly defined. His introduction and afterword place the letters in the context of Steinbeck's career, including his later doubts about the war.</p> (<i>Shelf Awareness</i>)<br><br><p> <i>Steinbeck in Vietnam</i> contains some vivid descriptions of the fierceness of American firepower, the hazards of night combat and the beauty of the Vietnamese countryside. It also reflects the scorn that many 'hawks' and 'doves' had for one another, with Steinbeck critical of the anti-war protesters as stupid and cowardly.... Steinbeck spent a good deal of time in the field, and wrote about the bravery of helicopter pilots in the air and of the multiple dangers -- not just hostile gunfire, but also snakes, malaria and tripwire explosives -- faced by infantry on the ground. Barden notes, however, that Steinbeck was escorted by high-ranking officers everywhere he went and mainly saw what they wanted him to see.... Steinbeck came home to Sag Harbor and died of heart failure a year later, but not before reversing himself almost completely. While he did no more public writing about Vietnam (or anything else), he is known to have spent his last months privately questioning both the execution and legitimacy of the war."</p> (<i>Newsday</i>)<br><br><p>From December 1966 to May 1967, the Nobel Prize-winning author, with weapon in hand and pens and notepads stuffed in fatigue pockets, had slogged through the combat zones of South Vietnam. His closing words, filed from Tokyo on May 20, 1967, constitute one of the finest tributes ever made to the Americans who fought in the controversial conflict.... Steinbeck's extraordinary gifts as a writer and genius for observation give readers a profoundly accurate picture of the war during his time in country.</p> (<i>Daily Progress</i>)<br><br><p>Unless some undiscovered manuscript is uncovered, this will probably be the final book of Salinas native son John Steinbeck's work to be published.... If you collect John Steinbeck's writing or pride yourself on having read all of the author's work, you'll have to get this book.</p> (<i>The Salinas Californian</i>)<br><br><p>Decades after he penned the enduring literary classics <i>Of Mice and Men</i> and <i>The Grapes of Wrath,</i> 64-year-old John Steinbeck traveled to Vietnam in December 1966 to write about the war raging there. Steinbeck spent five months among the troops and sent back dozens of dispatches, which were published as a series of letters in <i>Newsday</i> and haven&#x2019;t been fully reprinted until now. In the new book <i>Steinbeck in Vietnam: Dispatches From the War,</i> scholar Thomas Barden collects all of the author&#x2019;s accounts, which constitute hislast published writings before his death in 1968. While Steinbeck publicly expressed his support for the war and was criticized for it, his private feelings were more conflicted, says Barden, a dean and professor of English at the University of Toledo in Ohio.</p> (<i>U.S. News Weekly</i>)</p><h2>Masters of British Literature, Volume B</h2><p>Written by an editorial team whose members are all actively engaged in teaching and in current scholarship, <i>Masters of British Literature</i> is a concise, yet comprehensive survey of the key writers whose classic works have shaped British literature.&nbsp; Featuring major works by the most influential authors in the British literary tradition&#x2013;Barbauld, Blake, Wollstonecraft, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Barrett Browning, Browning, Tennyson, Yeats, Woolf, Joyce, Eliot, Walcott, Heaney, and Rushdie&#x2013;this compact anthology combines comprehensive coverage of the enduring works of the British literary tradition from the Romantics through the twentieth century.

This extraordinary book uncovers the long-forgotten story of the <i>Hankey</i>, from its altruistic beginnings to its disastrous end, and describes the ship&#x2019;s fateful impact upon people from West Africa to Philadelphia, Haiti to London.&nbsp;Billy G. Smith chased the story of the <i>Hankey</i> from archive to archive across several continents, and he now brings back to light a saga that continues to haunt the modern world. It began with a group of high-minded British colonists who planned to establish a colony free of slavery in West Africa. With the colony failing, the ship set sail for the Caribbean and then North America, carrying, as it turned out, mosquitoes infected with yellow fever. The resulting pandemic as the <i>Hankey</i> traveled from one port to the next was catastrophic. In the United States, tens of thousands died in Philadelphia, New York, Boston, and Charleston. The few survivors on the <i>Hankey</i> eventually limped back to London, hopes dashed and numbers decimated. Smith links the voyage and its deadly cargo to some of the most significant events of the era&#x2014;the success of the Haitian slave revolution, Napoleon&#x2019;s decision to sell the Louisiana Territory, a change in the geopolitical situation of the new United States&#x2014;and spins a riveting tale of unintended consequences and the legacy of slavery that will not die.</p><p><b>Billy G.

In this gripping, grisly story of slavery, rebellion and yellow fever holocaust ricocheting around the Atlantic rim, Smith brilliantly shows how stowaway mosquitoes on a single ship reconfigured the societies of Africa, Europe, the West Indies, and North America as well as the armies and navies of Great Britain and other maritime nations.&#x201d;&#x2014;Gary B.

Despite the publication of hundreds of textbooks in this field, each one intended to provide an improvement over previous textbooks, students of economics continue to remain perplexed as a result of numerous subject areas that must be remembered and correlated when solving problems. Various interpretations of economics terms also contribute to the difficulties of mastering the subject.<br><br>In a study of economics, REA found the following basic reasons underlying the inherent difficulties of economics:<br><br>No systematic rules of analysis were ever developed to follow in a step-by-step manner to solve typically encountered problems. This results from numerous different conditions and principles involved in a problem that leads to many possible different solution methods. To prescribe a set of rules for each of the possible variations would involve an enormous number of additional steps, making this task more burdensome than solving the problem directly due to the expectation of much trial and error.<br><br>Current textbooks normally explain a given principle in a few pages written by an economics professional who has insight into the subject matter not shared by others. These explanations are often written in an abstract manner that causes confusion as to the principle's use and application. Explanations then are often not sufficiently detailed or extensive enough to make the reader aware of the wide range of applications and different aspects of the principle being studied. The numerous possible variations of principles and their applications are usually not discussed, and it is left to the reader to discover this while doing exercises. Accordingly, the average student is expected to rediscover that which has long been established and practiced, but not always published or adequately explained.<br><br>The examples typically following the explanation of a topic are too few in number and too simple to enable the student to obtain a thorough grasp of the involved principles. The explanations do not provide sufficient basis to solve problems that may be assigned for homework or given on examinations.<br><br>Poorly solved examples such as these can be presented in abbreviated form which leaves out much explanatory material between steps, and as a result requires the reader to figure out the missing information. This leaves the reader with an impression that the problems and even the subject are hard to learn - completely the opposite of what an example is supposed to do.<br><br>Poor examples are often worded in a confusing or obscure way. They might not state the nature of the problem or they present a solution, which appears to have no direct relation to the problem. These problems usually offer an overly general discussion - never revealing how or what is to be solved.<br><br>Many examples do not include accompanying diagrams or graphs, denying the reader the exposure necessary for drawing good diagrams and graphs. Such practice only strengthens understanding by simplifying and organizing economics processes.<br><br>Students can learn the subject only by doing the exercises themselves and reviewing them in class, obtaining experience in applying the principles with their different ramifications.<br><br>In doing the exercises by themselves, students find that they are required to devote considerable more time to economics than to other subjects, because they are uncertain with regard to the selection and application of the theorems and principles involved. It is also often necessary for students to discover those "tricks" not revealed in their texts (or review books) that make it possible to solve problems easily. Students must usually resort to methods of trial and error to discover these "tricks," therefore finding out that they may sometimes spend several hours to solve a single problem.<br><br>When reviewing the exercises in classrooms, instructors usually request students to take turns in writing solutions on the boards and explaining them to the class. Students often find it difficult to explain in a manner that holds the interest of the class, and enables the remaining students to follow the material written on the boards. The remaining students in the class are thus too occupied with copying the material off the boards to follow the professor's explanations.<br><br>This book is intended to aid students in economics overcome the difficulties described by supplying detailed illustrations of the solution methods that are usually not apparent to students. Solution methods are illustrated by problems that have been selected from those most often assigned for class work and given on examinations. The problems are arranged in order of complexity to enable students to learn and understand a particular topic by reviewing the problems in sequence. The problems are illustrated with detailed, step-by-step explanations, to save the students large amounts of time that is often needed to fill in the gaps that are usually found between steps of illustrations in textbooks or review/outline books.<br><br>The staff of REA considers economics a subject that is best learned by allowing students to view the methods of analysis and solution techniques. This learning approach is similar to that practiced in various scientific laboratories, particularly in the medical fields.<br><br>In using this book, students may review and study the illustrated problems at their own pace; students are not limited to the time such problems receive in the classroom.<br><br>When students want to look up a particular type of problem and solution, they can readily locate it in the book by referring to the index that has been extensively prepared. It is also possible to locate a particular type of problem by glancing at just the material within the boxed portions. Each problem is numbered and surrounded by a heavy black border for speedy identification.<br></p><p></p><h2>Anatomy of an Illness as Perceived by the Patient: Reflections on Healing and Regeneration</h2><p><p><strong>A special hardcover gift edition of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller: Norman Cousins's phenomenal bestseller on illness overcome and the triumph of the human spirit.</strong></p> The premise of Norman Cousins's enormously influential work is that the human mind is capable of promoting the body's capacity for combating illness and healing itself even when faced with a seemingly hopeless medical predicament.

Drawing on extensive verbatim stenographic records, he analyzes the ecumenical councils from A.D. 325 to 553, in which participants gave authority to doctrinal choices by majority vote.<br><br>The author investigates the sometimes astonishing bloodshed and violence that marked the background to church council proceedings, and from there goes on to describe the planning and staging of councils, the emperors' role, the routines of debate, the participants&#x2019; understanding of the issues, and their views on God&#x2019;s intervention in their activities.

What role did religion play in its formation? Athens, with its ancient citadel and central religious cult, has traditionally been the model for the emergence of the Greek city-state. But in this original and controversial investigation, Francois de Polignac suggests that the Athenian model was probably the exception, not the rule, in the development of the polis in ancient Greece.<br> <br> Combining archaeological and textual evidence, de Polignac argues that the eighth-century settlements that would become the city-states of classical Greece were defined as much by the boundaries of "civilized" space as by its urban centers. The city took shape through what de Polignac calls a "religious bipolarity," the cults operating both to organize social space and to articulate social relationships being not only at the heart of the inhabited area, but on the edges of the territory. Together with the urban cults, these sanctuaries "in the wild" identified the polis and its sphere of influence, giving rise to the concept of the state as a territorial unit distinct from its neighbors. Frontier sanctuaries were therefore often the focus of disputes between emerging communities. But in other instances, in particular in Greece's colonizing expeditions, these outer sanctuaries may have facilitated the relations between the indigenous populations and the settlers of the newly founded cities.<br> <br> Featuring extensive revisions from the original French publication and an updated bibliography, this book is essential for anyone interested in the history and culture of ancient Greece.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Ancient Greece: A History in Eleven Cities</h2><p>The contribution of the ancient Greeks to modern western culture is incalculable. In the worlds of art, architecture, myth, literature, and philosophy, the world we live in would be unrecognizable without the formative influence of ancient Greek models.<br> This highly original and stimulating introduction to ancient Greece takes the city as its starting point, revealing just how central the polis ("city-state" or "citizen-state") was to Hellenistic cultural achievements. In particular, Paul Cartledge uses the history of eleven major Greek cities--out of more than a thousand--to illuminate the most important and informative aspects of Greek history. The book spans a surprisingly long time period, ranging from the first examples of ancient Greek language from Cnossus in Crete around 1400 BC to the establishment of Constantinople (today's Istanbul) in 324 AD on the site of the Greek city of Byzantion. Cartledge highlights the role of such renowned cities as Athens (birthplace of democracy) and Sparta, but he also examines Argos, Thebes, Syracuse in Sicily, and Alexandria in Egypt, as well as lesser known locales such as Miletus (home of the West's first intellectual, Thales) and Massalia (Marseilles today), where the Greeks introduced the wine grape to the French. The author uses these cities to illuminate major themes, from economics, religion, and social relations, to gender and sexuality, slavery and freedom, and politics. And throughout, the book explores how these eleven cities differed both from each other and from modern society. <br> An innovative approach to ancient Greece and its legacy, both in terms of the time span covered and in its unique city-by-city organization, this superb volume provides the ideal concise introduction to the history and culture of this remarkable civilization.</p><p><br><strong>Paul Cartledge</strong> is the inaugural A.G.

He is also Hellenic Parliament Global Distinguished Professor in the History and Theory of Democracy, at New York University. He is the author, co-author, editor and co-editor of over 20 books, many translated into several foreign languages. He is an honorary citizen of modern Sparta and holds the Gold Cross of the Order of Honor awarded by the President of Greece.<br>Cartledge, professor of Greek culture at the University of Cambridge, has created an intriguing overview of Greek history by providing synopses of 11 key city-states, each representing a different facet of Greek life and culture, such as politics, gender, and philosophy. Beginning with the earliest example of the successful polis, proto-Greek Cnossos on the island of Crete, and continuing through the near-mythical city of Mycenae; Argos; doomed Miletus; Massalia (present-day Marseilles), the first of the great Greek colonies; and through to the rise of laconic Sparta, it is easy to trace the development of Greek civilization. Classical Greece is examined in the descriptions of Athens, Syracuse, and Thebes. The description of Hellenic Alexandria is symbolic of the transition of the classical period into the Hellenistic age. A final discussion of the polis of Byzantion notes the decline of city-state independence. A list of significant individuals, a glossary, and a time line are beneficial. Other than labeling Athens, Ga., as that state's capital in comments on the proliferation of Greek city names throughout the world, errors are few. 20 b&amp;w illus., 4 maps. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Answer: Postmodernism. But what exactly is postmodernism? This graphic guide explains clearly the maddeningly enigmatic concept that has been used to define the world&#39;s cultural condition over the last three decades. &#34;Introducing Postmodernism&#34; tracks the idea back to its roots by taking a tour of some of the most extreme and exhilarating events, people and thought of the last 100 years: in art - constructivism, conceptual art, Marcel Duchamp, Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol; in politics and history - McCarthy&#39;s witch-hunts, feminism, Francis Fukuyama and the Holocaust; in philosophy - the work of Derrida, Baudrillard, Foucault and Heidegger. The book also explores postmodernism&#39;s take on today, and the anxious grip of globalization, unpredictable terrorism and unforeseen war that greeted the dawn of the 21st century. Regularly controversial, rarely straightforward and seldom easy, postmodernism is nonetheless a thrilling intellectual adventure. &#34;Introducing Postmodernism&#34; is the ideal guide.</p><p>Richard Appignanesi is a novelist, editor and publisher, and a Research Fellow at King&#39;s College London.

Here are worlds enough and more for every reader, fantasy fan, and passionate browser.<br></p><p><i>The Dictionary of Imaginary Places</i> is best described as a guidebook of the make-believe. A good way to understand what Alberto Manguel and Gianni Guadalupi set out to do with their book is to imagine that you want to travel to a place like Oz, as in <i>The Wizard of</i>. What you remember from watching the classic movie and what you would want to know as a traveler are two very distinct things. What you'll earn in this book is that Oz is a large rectangular country where everyone works half the time and plays half the time, one that is divided into four smaller countries: Munchkin Country, Winkie Country, Quadling Country, and Gillikin Country. Flip through more of the book's alphabetized listings and you'll discover Fuddlecumjig, a town in Oz's Quadling Country whose inhabitants, the Fuddles, are among the most curious people in Oz. The main peculiarity is that they are made of many pieces, rather like jigsaw puzzles, and literally fall apart when strangers approach, and have to be reassembled with skill and patience. A travel tip for readers with vivid imaginations: put Fuddlecumjig's cook together first if you want a meal. And so go the descriptions of more than 1,200 worlds invented by storytellers throughout history, from Homer's Wandering Rocks in the Odyssey to Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park. But there's more here than just the worlds of literature and film. You can learn more about John Lennon's Nutopia from his album <i>Mind Games</i>. Nutopia is a country with no land, no boundaries, no passports, and no laws other than cosmic laws. And the Beatles' Pepperland from Yellow Submarine is described as a country 18,000 leagues beneath the Sea of Green, where inhabitants dress in bright colors and rainbows are frequent. Written with rich descriptions that bring places to life, <i>The Dictionary of Imaginary Places</i> is a wonderful, magical reference book perfect for fiction lovers. <i>--John Russell</i>Throughout the ages, writers have created an astonishing diversity of imaginary places, worlds of enchantment, horror and delight.

In these 10 essays he explores the ethical and political dimensions of the modernity/postmodernity debates. Bernstein argues that modernity/postmodernity should be understood as a pervasive mood - what Heidegger calls a Stimmung - one that is amorphous, shifting, and protean but that nevetheless exerts a powerful influence on our current ways of thinking and acting. Focusing on such thinkers as Heidegger, Derrida, Foucault, Rorty, and Habermas, Bernstein seeks to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of their work and to highlight the ways in which they have contributed to the formation of a new and distinctive constellation of ideas and themes.EssaysPhilosophy, History, and Critique ï¿½ The Rage Against Reason ï¿½ Incommensurability and Otherness Revisited ï¿½ Heidegger&#39;s Silence?

(THE STATISTICIAN)</p><h2>Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World.</h2><p><p>Many of us, especially since 9/11, have become personally concerned about issues of security, and this is no surprise. Security is near the top of government and corporate agendas around the globe. Security-related stories appear on the front page everyday. How well though, do any of us truly understand what achieving real security involves?<br><br>In Beyond Fear, Bruce Schneier invites us to take a critical look at not just the threats to our security, but the ways in which we're encouraged to think about security by law enforcement agencies, businesses of all shapes and sizes, and our national governments and militaries. Schneier believes we all can and should be better security consumers, and that the trade-offs we make in the name of security - in terms of cash outlays, taxes, inconvenience, and diminished freedoms - should be part of an ongoing negotiation in our personal, professional, and civic lives, and the subject of an open and informed national discussion.<br><br>With a well-deserved reputation for original and sometimes iconoclastic thought, Schneier has a lot to say that is provocative, counter-intuitive, and just plain good sense. He explains in detail, for example, why we need to design security systems that don't just work well, but fail well, and why secrecy on the part of government often undermines security. He also believes, for instance, that national ID cards are an exceptionally bad idea: technically unsound, and even destructive of security. And, contrary to a lot of current nay-sayers, he thinks online shopping is fundamentally safe, and that many of the new airline security measure (though by no means all) are actually quite effective. A skeptic of much that's promised by highly touted technologies like biometrics, Schneier is also a refreshingly positive, problem-solving force in the often self-dramatizing and fear-mongering world of security pundits.<br><br>Schneier helps the reader to understand the issues at stake, and how to best come to one's own conclusions, including the vast infrastructure we already have in place, and the vaster systems--some useful, others useless or worse--that we're being asked to submit to and pay for.<br><br>Bruce Schneier is the author of seven books, including Applied Cryptography (which Wired called "the one book the National Security Agency wanted never to be published") and Secrets and Lies (described in Fortune as "startlingly lively...ï¿½[a] jewel box of little surprises you can actually use."). He is also Founder and Chief Technology Officer of Counterpane Internet Security, Inc., and publishes Crypto-Gram, one of the most widely read newsletters in the field of online security. <br></p></p><p><p>Bruce Schneier is the author of seven books, including Applied Cryptography which Wired called "the one book the National Security Agency wanted never to be published" and Secrets and Lies, described in Fortune as a "startlingly lively jewel box of little surprises you can actually use."

His documetary film&nbsp;<i>Four Hours in My Lai</i> garnered an International Emmy Award for Best Documentary.&nbsp;Bilton has also taught journalism at universities in Great Britain, the United States, and Denmark.<br><br><b>Kevin Sim </b>is a British documentary filmmaker whose credits include <i>Once Upon a Time in Iran</i>, <i>The Secret Life of the Berlin Wall</i>, and <i>Four Hours in My Lai</i>, which won an International Emmy Award for Best Documentary.Brilliantly realized study of the infamous Vietnam War atrocity in which US soldiers burned a Vietnamese village to the ground, shot the livestock, raped the women, and drove 400 men, women, and children into a ditch to slaughter them with machine- gun fire. Bilton and Sim (Women at War, 1982)--who co-produced an Emmy-winning TV-documentary on My Lai--begin by speaking with Varnardo Simpson, gunner with Charlie Company, 1969; for 20 years he has imprisoned himself in a tiny shack, tortured by memories. Through extraordinary research, the authors go on to discover the sad fates of several of Simpson's fellow vets; talk with Vietnamese survivors of the bloodbath; reveal facts cloaked by the Army's court-martial system; expose White House machinations to obscure ``a grave breach'' of the 1949 Geneva Convention; and document a coverup involving dozens of officers right up to the rank of major general. Only one soldier was court-martialed for the massacre: Lt. William Calley. And, as the authors explain, initial public outrage gave way, apparently as the result of manipulations by Richard Nixon, to the sentiment that Calley was a martyr: When the soldier was convicted of premeditated murder, Nixon ordered him released from Leavenworth. By the authors' account, there was only one hero at My Lai: young helicopter pilot Hugh Thompson. Seeing Charlie Company driving children to the killing ditch, Thompson landed in front of troops, trained his machine guns on them, and rescued the children. In a supreme irony, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross: his sound judgment ``had greatly enhanced Vietnamese-American relations in the operational area.'' Thompson threw the decoration away. Savagery, the authors declare, has been endemic to every American conflict: in 1902, US troops in the Philippines slaughtered ``goo-goos'' indiscriminately; in WW II, soldiers sent their girlfriends Japanese skulls. But why is it continually repeated? ``Massacre has a short shelf life,'' say Bilton and Sim. Essential for the war scholar's bookshelf; for the generalist, a profoundly moving human document.

Andrew Jackson was at the forefront of the American revolution&#x2015;but he never could have made it without the support of his wife. Beautiful, charismatic, and generous, Rachel Jackson had the courage to go against the mores of her times in the name of love. As the wife of a great general in wartime, she often found herself running their plantation alone and, a true heroine, she took in and raised children orphaned by the war. Like many great love stories, this one ends tragically when Rachel dies only a few weeks after Andrew is elected president. He moved into the White House alone and never remarried. Andrew and Rachel Jackson's devotion to one another is inspiring, and here, in Patricia Brady's vivid prose, their story of love and loss comes to life for the first time.</p></p><p><p><b>Patricia Brady </b>is a social and cultural historian who served as director of publications at the Historic New Orleans Collection for twenty years. Her books include <i>Martha Washington: An American Life </i> and <i>George Washington's Beautiful Nelly</i>. She lives in New Orleans.</p>&#34;A fast-paced political drama combined with a controversial love story that was shocking in its day. Patricia Brady&#39;s A Being So Gentle is, frankly, irresistible.&#34; - John Berendt, bestselling author of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil &#39;No picture of the charismatic and compelling Andrew Jackson is complete without an understanding of his utter devotion to his &#39;dearest heart,&#39; his wife Rachel. Jackson&#39;s fury at the political attacks on his wife as an unsavory adulteress affected everything he did as president. But Patricia Brady reveals that Jackson spent a lifetime in defense of the beauty he eloped with while she was married to another man. Here finally we have a book that looks at the relationship between the general and his wife from both of their perspectives and puts it in the context of the world they lived in - the rough and daring eighteenth century American frontier.&#39; - Cokie Roberts, bestselling author of Founding Mothers and Ladies of Liberty &#39;Rachel Donelson was truly a child of wilderness America and her second husband, Andrew Jackson, a force of nature. Their story, a compelling one, is told here with passion and zest.&#39; - Andrew Burstein, author of The Passions of Andrew Jackson &#34;Patricia Brady&#39;s lively and engaging account of the Jackson marriage shows her zest for history and for bringing forgotten founding women into the historical spotlight. Rendered with delicate strokes, Rachel Robards Jackson emerges as a loving wife and gentle presence, the lamb to the American lion.&#34; - Catherine Allgor, author of A Perfect Union: Dolley Madison and the Creation of the American Nation &#34;A lively and eminently readable account of the relationship between Andrew Jackson and his wife Rachel. Brady demonstrates that, despite the scandal for which it is most frequently remembered, theirs was a marriage of great duration and affection. While Andrew Jackson&#39;s activities form the backbone of the story, Brady breathes life into the lesser-known figure of Rachel, who steadfastly supported her husband throughout his improbable rise to prominence. Dying on the cusp of her husband&#39;s inauguration as president, Rachel missed out on the opportunity of serving as the nation&#39;s First Lady and never had the chance to restore her reputation. This book does that for her.&#34; - Margaret A. Hogan, The Adams Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society and Co-Editor, My Dearest Friend: Letters of Abigail and John Adams &#34;A Being So Gentle is a true love story--in which love triumphs over quite daunting odds--which requires no romantic embellishment, just the simple facts. Moreover, by looking at Andrew Jackson mostly through the eyes of Rachel, Patricia Brady has got his extravagant career down to a manageable size.&#34; - Madison Smartt Bell, author of All Souls&#39; Rising &#34;Although Rachel Jackson died before her husband&#39;s inauguration, no history of the job of first lady can ignore her. She cast a long shadow over her husband&#39;s presidency. Patricia Brady uncovers the mystery behind the woman and gives a lively account of the Jackson love story. It is a frontier romance, with a botched divorce and a duel to protect Rachel&#39;s honor, but rumors about it played out on a national stage, causing rifts in Washington&#39;s social cliques and political realignments.&#34; - Betty Boyd Caroli, author of First Ladies: From Martha Washington to Michelle Obama &#34;On the very eve of his presidency, after thirty-seven years of marriage, General Andrew Jackson buried his beloved Rachel in the dress she planned to wear for his inauguration. A Being So Gentle is a brilliant story of triumph and tragedy. It brings the Jacksons&#39; poignant love story to life against the backdrop of antebellum America&#39;s bustling expansion and political intrigue -- and it demonstrates once again that Patricia Brady is a historian who writes beautifully!&#34; - Jon Kukla, author of Mr. Jefferson&#39;s Women and A Wilderness So Immense</p><h2>California Place Names: The Origin and Etymology of Current Geographical Names</h2><p><i>Absco</i>, a Southern Pacific station, was coined in the 1920s from the name of the American Beet Sugar Company, which had a factory in Oxnard.<br><br><i>Pochea</i> is an Indian village site in Riverside County, said to mean "where the rabbit went in."<br><br><i>Siskiyou</i> was the Chinook word for 'bobtailed horse,' originally taken over from the Cree language.

However, such critiques imply that though intelligence tests may miss certain key noncognitive areas, they encompass most of what is important in the cognitive domain. In this book, Keith E. Stanovich challenges this widely held assumption.</p><p>Stanovich shows that IQ tests (or their proxies, such as the SAT) are radically incomplete as measures of cognitive functioning. They fail to assess traits that most people associate with &#x201c;good thinking,&#x201d; skills such as judgment and decision making. Such cognitive skills are crucial to real-world behavior, affecting the way we plan, evaluate critical evidence, judge risks and probabilities, and make effective decisions. IQ tests fail to assess these skills of rational thought, even though they are measurable cognitive processes. Rational thought is just as important as intelligence, Stanovich argues, and it should be valued as highly as the abilities currently measured on intelligence tests.</p></p><p><p><b>Keith E.

Johnson-Laird)<br><br>"Professor Stanovich has an unparalleled ability to synthesize results from diverse domains of cognitive science in a lively way that is tremendously useful to us non-specialists.&nbsp;This book is not about emotional or multiple intelligence; it's about <i><i>intelligence </i></i>in its most important practical dimensions."&#x2014;E.

Stanovich, one of psychology&#x2019;s wisest writers about intelligence, also shows that IQ tests do not measure the full scope of mental ability because they fail to assess rational thought, which is central to happiness and fulfillment.

It then introduces partial derivatives via functions of two variables and then extends the discussion to more than two variables.

It overcomes the difficulty of visualizing curves and surfaces from equations with the use of many computer graphics in full color, and it contains more than 250 exercises. With applications to economics and an emphasis on practical problem-solving in the sciences rather than the proof of formal theorems, this text should provide excellent motivation to students.</p><p>This is the second edition of a popular text for a course in calculus of functions of several variables.

For most, Irish cuisine means potatoes, corned beef, and cabbage. Now at last, <i>The Irish Heritage Cookbook</i> will set the record straight. Margaret Johnson offers a much-needed fresh perspective on what Irish cooking is all about. She tells stories about the foods of Erin and how these dishes were reinvented by Irish emigrants and their offspring, evolving to include new ingredients and to suit modern circumstances and tastes. Offering a bountiful collection of both traditional recipes and contemporary innovations from a host of chefs and cooks in the Old Country and the New, <i>The Irish Heritage Cookbook</i> affirms at last the place of Irish cooking among the great cuisines of the world&#x2014;and one to be enjoyed by all who love Ireland.</p><p>Margaret Johnson grew up in a traditional Irish-Catholic neighborhood in Massachusetts. A high school teacher in New York state, she takes advantage of her long summer vacations to travel to Ireland regularly, and has published numerous Irish travel and food articles.Food writer and Massachusetts native Johnson delivers a fresh perspective on Irish cookery with an engaging collection of recipes culled from Irish (and Irish-American) chefs, hoteliers and long-time home cooks who have reinterpreted traditional dishes with earthy panache. Organized by topography?hill, dale, waters, etc.?chapters include historic sidebars and anecdotes, such as information on medieval Irish castle banquets. Despite an occasional gourmet detour (e.g., Mussel Soup with Oatmeal-Herb Crust or Warm Woodland Salad with Champagne Vinaigrette), robust, rustic Irish cooking prevails. Recipes are not for the diet conscious: copious amounts of butter and cream, meat-with-meat pairings and other caloric combinations predominate (e.g., Black Pudding Roisin, with pig blood sausage; Dublin Coddle, a pork, bacon and potato casserole; Quail with Chestnut Stuffing and Burgundy Sauce). Ireland's culinary "roots" (carrots, turnips, parsnips and tubers) as well as distinctly Irish libations (stout, whiskey and poitins, a distillation of barley, sugar and water), punctuate many recipes. Relatively uncomplicated, many of these meals involve minimal preparation time and can be easily rendered by novice home cooks. Looking beyond boiled potatoes and cabbage, Johnson provides valuable insight into Ireland's gastronomic heritage. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Teachings of the Hindu Mystics</h2><p>This anthology collects the most lyrical, passionate, illuminating writings of the Hindu mystical tradition. Andrew Harvey, the popular spiritual scholar and writer, has selected excerpts from ancient and contemporary sources, including extracts from the <i>Bhagavad Gita, </i> the <i>Upanishads,</i> and other classical Hindu texts; the words of such venerable spiritual teachers as Ramakrishna and Ramana Maharshi; and the devotional poetry of Mirabai, Ramprasad, and many others. The scope of this anthology makes it a marvelous introduction to Hindu mystical literature, while the power and beauty of the language will inspire those already familiar with the genre.</p><p>Andrew Harvey is the author of&nbsp;<i>Son of Man: The Mystical Path to Christ&nbsp;</i>and more than thirty other books. He has also published several other collections of Rumi, including&nbsp;<i>The Way of Passion.</i>Harvey, a British novelist who more recently has become a writer devoted to spiritual topics, has edited this new contribution to Shambhala's long-running "Teachings" series, and this volume is one of the most valuable for the general public yet released. Hindu practice and spirituality remain frustratingly alien and elusive for many Western minds, not least because of the continual overlays of new teachings by recognized masters. Harvey's anthology is historical, and by beginning with the Rig Veda and concluding with the writings of Aurobindo (d. 1950), he goes far toward establishing the essence of Hinduism itself and the ebbs and flows in its teaching over hundreds of years. Harvey's introduction is both learned and prophetic in its stance. Highly recommended. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Romeo and Juliet (The Annotated Shakespeare)</h2><p><p>Shakespeare&#x2019;s <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> is perhaps the most read and beloved of all stage works.

From 'How country music and working with hearing-impaired adults are alike', using the grief and emotion ubiquitous in country music to frame and explain the psychology of many patients that walk through our doors every day. To 'Yes we're here to tell you why dispensing hearing aids in a commercial environment can be a lot like college basketball', which explains how using a collaborate and consultative approach can take the fear of 'selling' or of being 'sold to' out of the picture. . . . The fact is that the content in this book is brilliant and rooted in up-to-date evidence and its delivery is clear and effective. It is not aiming to be a reference tome and it does not go into detail often, but it will only take up a relatively small amount of space on your shelf.

The work is clinically based and provides step-by-step instructions and procedures. These protocols can be easily adapted to private practices, ENT physician offices, and university clinics . . . The authors accomplished what they set out to do--provide the audiology community with a text that is educational yet entertaining . . . The text reads well and the 'readability' is enhanced by the infusion of humor as well as a 'theme' for each chapter. From country western song lyrics to wine tasting to baseball and basketball, the authors have woven these 'themes' into the information to provide us a text that is entertaining and inspiring. This text rates a 10 on the RI (Readability Index, not to be confused with the Rollover Index) . . . I would highly recommend this text to those in academia who want to add a course in hearing aids to their undergraduate programs or who would like to infuse more information on hearing aids into an undergraduate aural rehabilitation course. It is also a valuable resource for those working as audiology assistants or technicians. Hearing aid license boards may want to consider adopting some of the chapters in this text as mandatory reading for the license examinations. This text is a great addition to our selection of resources on hearing aids.</i> --<b>Rose L.

For the first time in the history of Beowulf scholarship, the poem appears alongside the other four texts from its sole surviving manuscript: the prose Passion of Saint Christopher, The Wonders of the East, The Letter of Alexander the Great to Aristotle, and (following <i>Beowulf</i>) the poem Judith. First-time readers as well as established scholars can now gain new insights into <i>Beowulf</i>&#x2014;and the four other texts&#x2014;by approaching each in its original context. </p><p> </p><p> Could a fascination with the monstrous have motivated the compiler of this manuscript, working over a thousand years ago, to pull together this diverse grouping into a single volume? The prose translation by <b>R. D. Fulk</b>, based on the most recent editorial understanding, allows readers to rediscover Beowulf&#x2019;s brilliant mastery along with otherworldly delights in the four companion texts in The <i>Beowulf</i> Manuscript. </p></p><p>R. D. Fulk is Chancellor&#x2019;s Professor of English at Indiana University, Bloomington.Understandably, interest in the manuscript has centered on <i>Beowulf</i>, and it is still called the <i>Beowulf</i> manuscript here, though--unprecedentedly--this new book contains both text and translations of all the Nowell manuscript's items: the three prose works that precede <i>Beowulf</i>--<i>The Passion of St. Christopher</i>, <i>The Wonders of the East</i>, and <i>The Letters of Alexander the Great to Aristotle</i>--as well as <i>Judith</i>. It is an inspired project. R. D. Fulk is one of the world's leading Beowulfians...Fulk has produced an elegant, slightly archaized prose version of the poem ("He lived to see remedy for that") that keeps to the same register for all the items in the manuscript. His textual notes are predictably authoritative, and he conveys a remarkable amount of information within a small compass in his notes to the translations. ...This delightful book is a particularly graceful member of the beautifully produced Dumbarton Oaks series.

Mankiw emphasizes material that you are likely to find interesting about the economy (particularly if you are studying economics for the first time), including real-life scenarios, useful facts, and the many ways economic concepts play a role in the decisions you make every day. &#34;I have tried to put myself in the position of someone seeing economics for the first time. My goal is to emphasize the material that students should and do find interesting about the study of the economy.&#34;--N. Gregory Mankiw.</p><p>N. Gregory Mankiw is Professor of Economics at Harvard University. As a student, he studied economics at Princeton University and MIT. As a teacher, he has taught macroeconomics, microeconomics, statistics, and principles of economics. He even spent one summer long ago as a sailing instructor on Long Beach Island. Professor Mankiw is a prolific writer and a regular participant in academic and policy debates. His work has been published in scholarly journals such as the American Economic Review, Journal of Political Economy, and Quarterly Journal of Economics, and in more popular forums such as The New York Times, The Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Fortune. He is also author of the best-selling intermediate-level textbook Macroeconomics (Worth Publishing). In addition to his teaching, research, and writing, Professor Mankiw has been a research associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research, an adviser to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Congressional Budget Office, and a member of the Educational Testing Service (ETS) test development committee for the advanced placement exam in economics. From 2003 to 2005, he served as Chairman of the President&#39;s Council of Economic Advisers."One of the reasons why we adopted the Mankiw text was because of its relevant concepts that students could really relate to. I would say to continue with this trend, and also be sure to use examples that relate to the current economic conditions that make sense to a beginner economics student."<br><br>"I have used Mankiw for several years, across at least 3 or 4 of its editions. I like the writing in the book--it's clear and exposits the ideas effectively. It covers topics that I want to cover, mostly in the order that I like to cover them. It's at the appropriate level for our students--not too difficult but not superficial either. I also like the fact that this book is very closely integrated with the Aplia system, which I believe is an important learning tool."<br><br>"Very student friendly text.

They came to be seen as new civic centers: on the one hand as places of entertainment, leisure, and commerce, on the other as socially therapeutic institutions. But museums were also criticized for everything from elitism to looting or illegally exporting works from other countries, to exhibiting works offensive to the public taste.</p><br><br><p> <i>Whose Muse?</i> brings together five directors of leading American and British art museums who together offer a forward-looking alternative to such prevailing views. While their approaches differ, certain themes recur: As museums have become increasingly complex and costly to manage, and as government support has waned, the temptation is great to follow policies driven not by a mission but by the market. However, the directors concur that public trust can be upheld only if museums continue to see their core mission as building collections that reflect a nation's artistic legacy and providing informed and unfettered access to them.</p><br><p> The book, based on a lecture series of the same title held in 2000-2001 by the Harvard Program for Art Museum Directors, also includes an introduction by Cuno and a fascinating--and surprisingly frank--roundtable discussion among the participating directors. A rare collection of sustained reflections by prominent museum directors on the current state of affairs in their profession, this book is without equal. It will be read widely not only by museum professionals, trustees, critics, and scholars, but also by the art-loving public itself.</p></p><p><p>"Clearly written and quite accessible, the papers in this volume will reinforce the traditional view of art museums held by many readers while also addressing recent challenges to the museum's legitimacy as a public institution."<b>--Bruce J.

It enables modern engineers to understand what assumptions their predecessors made, what materials they used, how they designed structures, and how their designs were built. Architects renovating older buildings, while not usually responsible for structural design, need to understand the design restrictions forced on them by the original structures.<br><br> A guide to the physical construction of buildings from the 1840s to the present, <em>Historical Building Construction</em> uses narrative, drawings, and photographs to describe the development of masonry, wood, and steel construction, modern curtain walls and concrete slabs, and the use of cast iron and patented floor construction. It provides case histories to show how this information is applied to actual projects, ranging from brownstones to skyscrapers.<br><br> In order to show a consistent and well-documented set of examples evolving in chronological order, New York City is used as model, since many examples of obsolete forms are still available for examination. The general information given applies, with few exceptions, to buildings of the same types built all over the United States during the same period, and these are referenced as needed.<br><br> Every designer who works on old structures or studies them will find in Historical Building Construction help in the process of analyzing existing conditions in a building and suggestions for dealing with what lies hidden behind floor, wall, and ceiling finishes.<br></p><p>Donald Friedman, author of Historical Building Construction, is the president of Old Structures Engineering and lives in New York City.&#x201c;[A] classic in the field....A modern engineer attempting to renovate or rehabilitate buildings needs to understand the mundane as well as the exceptional in order to design the most effective and least intrusive solution. <em>Historical Building Construction</em> offers an engaging way to develop that understanding.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Civil Engineering</em></strong></p><h2>World History: Patterns of Interaction: Reading Study Guide, English</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

In the process, he gives us an entirely new perspective on the value, the relevance, and even the charm of the Western ethical tradition.<br><br>Drawing on thinkers from Aristotle to Simone Weil, by way of Aquinas, Kant, Rilke, Nietzsche, Spinoza, and Rawls, among others, Comte-Sponville elaborates on the qualities that constitute the essence and excellence of humankind. Starting with politeness -- almost a virtue -- and ing with love -- which transcs all morality -- A Small Treatise on the Great Virtues takes us on a tour of the eighteen essential virtues: fidelity, prudence, temperance, courage, justice, generosity, compassion, mercy, gratitude, humility, simplicity, tolerance, purity, gentleness, good faith, and even, surprisingly, humor.Sophisticated and lucid, full of wit and vivacity, this modestly titled yet immensely important work provides an indispensable guide to finding what is right and good in everyday life.<br></p><p><b>Andrï¿½ Comte-Sponville</b> is one of the most important and popular of the new wave of young French philosophers. Now in his early forties, he teaches at the Sorbonne and is the author of five highly acclaimed scholarly books of classical philosophy. <i>A Small Treatise on the Great Virtues</i> spent fourteen months on the French bestseller list and is being translated into nineteen languages. He lives in Paris.<br><b>A Small Treatise on the Great Virtues</b><br><b>1</b><b>POLITENESS</b>Politeness is the first virtue, and the origin perhaps of all the others. It is also the poorest, the most superficial, and the most debatable of the virtues, and possibly something other than a virtue as well. In any case, as virtues go it&#x2019;s a small one, an easy virtue, one might say, as used to be said in reference to certain women. Politeness doesn&#x2019;t care about morality, and vice versa. If a Nazi is polite, does that change anything about Nazism or the horrors of Nazism? No. It changes nothing, and this <i>nothing</i> is the very hallmark of politeness. A virtue of pure form, of etiquette and ceremony! A show of virtue, its appearance and nothing more.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Politeness is certainly a value, but it is an ambiguous one, insufficient in itself. It can clothe both the best and the worst, which makes it suspect. Such attention to form must be hiding something, but what? Politeness is artifice and we tend to be wary of artifice; it is an adornment and we tend to be wary of adornments. Diderot speaks somewhere of the &#x201c;insulting politeness&#x201d; of those on high; one might also mention the obsequious or servile politeness of those below. Unadorned contempt and crass obedience seem preferable.But that&#x2019;s not the worst of it. A polite bastard is no less vile than any other bastard and in fact may be more vile. Is it because he is also a hypocrite ? Probably not: politeness makes no moral claims for itself. A polite bastard, moreover, could just as easily be cynical without being any less polite or any less wicked for it. So what is it about him that shocks us? It&#x2019;s the contrast, undoubtedly, but not the contrast between an appearance of virtue and virtue&#x2019;s absence (which would be hypocrisy): our hypothetical bastard really is polite&#x2014;besides, there&#x2019;s no difference between seeming to be polite and actually being so. The contrast is rather between the appearance of one virtue (in the case of politeness, appearance is reality: what you see is all there is) and the absence of all others; or, better yet, between the appearance of virtue and the presence of vice&#x2014;in this case meanness, arguably the only true vice. Yet, taken in isolation, the contrast is more aesthetic than moral, which would explain why we respond to polite villainy with surprise rather than horror, astonishment rather than disapproval. There is, of course, an ethical dimension to the contrast: politeness makes the wicked person even more hateful because it implies a good upbringing, in the absence of which the wickedness might have been somehow excusable. The polite bastard is no wild animal, quite the opposite, and wild animals we generally do not resent; he is anything but unsocialized, and those who are we tend to find excuses for. He is the very antithesis of the crude, coarse, ignorant brute, who may frighten us, to be sure, but whose native and shortsighted violence can at least be explained by his lack of education. The polite bastard is not an animal, or a savage, or a brute. On the contrary, he is civilized, educated, well bred; there is no excuse for him, you could say. With the boor, who can tell whether he&#x2019;s ill-intentioned or simply ill-mannered? Genteel torturers, however, never leave us in doubt. Just as blood is more visible on white gloves, so horror is more apparent when it is also civilized. Nazis, at least some of them, are said to have excelled in this role. And, indeed, part of the ignominy we associate with the Nazis has to do precisely with this mixture of barbarism and civilization, of violence and courtesy; with this cruelty that was sometimes polite, sometimes bestial, but always cruel, and more blameworthy perhaps for its politeness, more inhuman for its human forms, more barbaric for its gestures of civility.I have digressed, perhaps, but not so much by accident as out of vigilance: the important thing about politeness is, first of all, not to be taken in by it. Politeness is not virtue and cannot take the place of virtue.In that case, why call it the first of the virtues, the origin of all the others? The contradiction is not as great as it may appear to be. The origin of the virtues cannot be a virtue (for if it were, it would itself require an origin, but then it could not be the origin it requires); it may be of the very essence of the virtues that the first one is not virtuous.But why is politeness the <i>first</i>? The priority I have in mind is not cardinal but temporal: politeness comes before the other virtues in the sense that it serves as a foundation for the moral development of the individual. A newborn baby doesn&#x2019;t have and can&#x2019;t have moral standards. Nor does an infant or, for quite some time, a small child. What the small child does discover, however, and discovers quite early on, is prohibition. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that: it&#x2019;s nasty; it&#x2019;s bad; it&#x2019;s not nice; it&#x2019;s naughty ...&#x201d; Or else, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s dangerous.&#x201d; Very soon he comes to learn the difference between what&#x2019;s simply bad (a misdeed) and what is also bad <i>for</i> him (a danger), between the hateful and the harmful. A misdeed is a strictly human evil, an evil that does no harm (at least not to the person who commits it), an evil without immediate or intrinsic danger. But then why is it prohibited, why must it not be done? Because. Because that&#x2019;s the way it is; because it&#x2019;s nasty, it&#x2019;s not nice, it&#x2019;s naughty, and so forth. For children, fact precedes right; or rather, right and wrong are simply facts themselves, like any others. Some things are allowed, some are forbidden; some things are done, some are not done. Good or bad? The rule suffices; it precedes judgment and is the basis for it. But then does the rule have no foundation other than convention, no justification other than usage and the respect for usage? Yes, it is a de facto rule, a rule of pure form, a rule of politeness! Don&#x2019;t say bad words; don&#x2019;t interrupt people; don&#x2019;t shove; don&#x2019;t steal; don&#x2019;t lie. To the child, all these prohibitions appear identical (&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not nice&#x201d;). The distinction between the ethical and the aesthetic will come only later, and gradually. Politeness thus precedes morality, or rather, morality at first is nothing more than politeness: a compliance with usage and its established rules, with the normative play of appearances&#x2014;a compliance with the world and the ways of the world.Now, a principle of Kantian ethics is that one cannot deduce what one should do from what is done. Yet the child in his early years is obliged to do just that, and it is only in this way that he becomes human. Kant himself concedes as much. &#x201c;Man can only become man by education,&#x201d; he writes. &#x201c;He is merely what education makes him,&#x201d; and the process begins with discipline, which &#x201c;changes animal nature into human nature.&#x201d;1 What better way to say it? Custom precedes value; obedience, respect; and imitation, duty. Hence politeness (&#x201c;one doesn&#x2019;t do that&#x201d;) precedes morality (&#x201c;one <i>shouldn&#x2019;t</i> do that&#x201d;); morality only comes into being little by little, as an internalized politeness that has freed itself from considerations of appearance and interest and focuses entirely on intentions (which politeness doesn&#x2019;t concern itself with). But how could this morality ever come into being if politeness were not there to begin with? Good manners precede and prepare the way for good deeds. Morality is like a politeness of the soul, an etiquette of the inner life, a code of duties, a ceremonial of the essential. Conversely, politeness can be likened to a morality of the body, an ethics of comportment, a code for life in society, a ceremonial of the inessential. &#x201c;Paper money,&#x201d; Kant says, but it&#x2019;s better than nothing and it would be as crazy to do away with it as to mistake it for real gold.2 &#x201c;Small change,&#x201d; he also says, merely the appearance of virtue, yet that which renders it &#x201c;comely.&#x201d;3 And what child would ever become virtuous without this appearance and comeliness?So morality starts at the bottom&#x2014;with politeness. But it has to start somewhere. There are no natural virtues; hence we must <i>become</i> virtuous. How? &#x201c;For the things we have to learn before we can do them,&#x201d; Aristotle explains, &#x201c;we learn by doing them.&#x201d;4 Yet how can we do them if we haven&#x2019;t learned them? There are two ways out of this circular causality: apriority is one way, politeness is the other. But apriority is beyond our reach; politeness is not. &#x201c;We become just,&#x201d; Aristotle continues, &#x201c;by doing just acts, temperate by doing temperate acts, brave by doing brave acts.&#x201d;5 But can we act justly without being just? Temperately without being temperate? Bravely without being brave? And if we cannot, then how do we become just, temperate, brave? Through habit, Aristotle seems to say, but that answer is obviously inadequate: a habit presupposes the prior existence of what we would be making a habit of and therefore cannot account for it. Kant provides a more helpful answer. For him, these first semblances of virtue can be explained in terms of discipline, in other words, as a product of external constraint: what the child cannot do on his own because he has no instinct for it &#x201c;others have to do ... for him,&#x201d; and in this way &#x201c;one generation educates the next.&#x201d;6 No doubt. And in the family, what is this discipline if not, first of all, a respect for usages and good manners? A discipline that is more normative than restrictive, it wants not order so much as a certain amiable sociability&#x2014;not police discipline but polite discipline. It is by mimicking the ways of virtue, that is, through politeness, that we stand a chance of becoming virtuous. &#x201c;P...</p><h2>The Machinery of Life</h2><p>All living cells are made up of an extraordinary collection of tiny molecular machines, which orchestrate the millions of tasks needed for life. Cells build these machines for a variety of purposes: to digest food, to propel them to fertile feeding grounds or away from predators, to store the genetic blueprint, and to fight disease-causing invaders. The Machinery of Life is a journey into the sub-microscopic world of molecular machines. The reader is first introduced to the types of molecules built by cells: proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and polysaccharides. In a series of distinctive illustrations, the reader is then guided through the interior world of cells, exploring the ways in which molecules work in concert to perform the processes of living. Finally, the book shows how vitamins, viruses, poisons, and drugs each have their effects on the molecules in our bodies. The author and illustrator, David Goodsell, has prepared a fascinating introduction to biochemistry for the nonspecialist. This book combines a clear text with an abundance of drawings and computer graphics that present the world of cells and their components in a new and unique way.</p><p>The cell is the basic unit of life, but most of us have at best a fuzzy, low-power idea of how cells are put together and what they look like. "The microscopic world of molecules is separated from our everyday world by an insurmountable, million-fold difference in size," says David Goodsell. "I created the illustrations in this book to help bridge this gulf and allow us to look at the molecular structure of cells, if not directly, then in an artistic rendition." Goodsell has succeeded remarkably. His pictures, mostly line drawings, show the structures of crucial biochemicals and the boggling intricacy of their arrangement in living cells. "A few minutes' study may be needed to overcome the feeling of claustrophobia," said <i>Nature</i>, "but will reward the reader with a lasting impression of the density and complexity of this soup of life." <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i>David Goodsell is in the Department of Molecular Biology at the Research Institute of Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, California, where his research integrates computer graphics and computational chemistry with the results of X-ray crystallography.</p><h2>Cassell's German &amp; English Dictionary</h2><p>The greatest name in foreign language dictionaries is Cassell, the preeminent publisher of dictionaries for over 120 years.<p>For fast, easy reference and comprehensive coverage, <i>Cassell's</i> is unbeatable.

He repeatedly faced accusations of turning a blind eye to human suffering to write artful tales of depravity. But does one of the greatest writers in the English language really deserve the label of amoral aesthete bestowed on him by so many critics?</p><p>Using information from newly-declassified intelligence files and recovered military history, journalist Andrea Pitzer argues that far from being a proponent of art for art&#x2019;s sake, Vladimir Nabokov managed to hide disturbing history in his fiction&#x2015;history that has gone unnoticed for decades. Nabokov emerges as a kind of documentary conjurer, spending the most productive decades of his career recording a saga of forgotten concentration camps and searing bigotry, from World War I to the Gulag and the Holocaust. Lolita surrenders Humbert Humbert&#x2019;s secret identity, and reveals a Nabokov appalled by American anti-Semitism. The lunatic narrator of <em>Pale Fire</em> recalls Russian tragedies that once haunted the world. From Tsarist courts to Nazi film sets, from CIA front organizations to wartime Casablanca, the story of Nabokov&#x2019;s family is the story of his century&#x2015;and both are woven inextricably into his fiction.</p></p><p>Andrea Pitzer&nbsp;founded Nieman Storyboard, the narrative nonfiction site of the&nbsp;Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University. Her work has also appeared in print in&nbsp;USA Today&#x2019;s&nbsp;Life section and online at&nbsp;HiLowbrow.com. She presented on Nabokov's fiction at the 2009 MLA Conference, is a graduate of Georgetown&#x2019;s School of Foreign Service, and lives in northern Virginia.&#x201c;Vladimir Nabokov (1899&#x2013;1977) always claimed that art and politics don&#x2019;t mix, but this new biography suggests his own art tells a different story. In her first book, Pitzer focuses on one of the lingering mysteries about Nabokov: How could anyone so acquainted with the horrors of the Soviet Union (which killed his father) and Nazi Germany (which killed his brother) be so detached from the real world in his work? According to Pitzer, in his own imaginative way, Nabokov was bearing witness to the horrors he knew. Drawing on new biographical material and her sharp critical senses, Pitzer reveals the tightly woven subtext of the novels, always keen to shine a light where the deception is not obvious. A brilliant examination that adds to the understanding of an inspiring and enigmatic life.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews, STARRED REVIEW</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Pitzer, like Nabokov, is a beautiful writer and gimlet-eyed observer, especially about her subject; even as an impoverished refugee living in America, she writes, &#x201c;Nabokov was never shy about his sense of self.&#x201d; Her attention to history&#x2019;s moral components is refreshingly blunt: &#x201c;The dead are not nameless,&#x201d; she writes of the writers and others killed in Stalin&#x2019;s Great Purge of the late 1930s. Inviting us to reconsider Nabokov, Pitzer also introduces herself as a writer worthy of attention.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Boston Globe</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Certainly the most remarkable and insightful book on Vladimir Nabokov in many years. It is by taking big history with its small devastating details into account that Pitzer brilliantly manages to unlock a secret door in the oeuvre of the often misunderstood Mandarin. A <em>must</em> for even non-Nabokovians.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Maar, author of</strong> Speak, Nabokov and The Two Lolitas<br><br>&#x201c; <p><strong>Journalist Pitzer tackles the life and work of Vladimir Nabokov (1899&#x2013;1977) from a critical and refreshing viewpoint different from previous biographies.</strong> She aims to&nbsp;connect the turbulent events in the author&#x2019;s life to the events in his fiction. A writer known for his appreciation of aesthetics over historically and politically themed plot lines, Nabokov lived through&nbsp;the Russian Revolution and the Holocaust (his brother Sergey died in a concentration camp). Pitzer shows how Nabokov&#x2019;s work relates these events in a way hidden from the reader. Drawing on the&nbsp;novels of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, she compares the authors&#x2019; lives and literary styles to illustrate the differences in how their fiction represents history; for example, Humbert&#x2019;s background in&nbsp;Lolitareflects such events as the Armenian genocide and the German concentration camps. Also, the speculation that he is Jewish perhaps represents the figure of the Wandering Jew.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>VERDICT&nbsp;Pitzer accomplishes her goal of revealing the indirect appearance of Nabokov&#x2019;s biography in his most celebrated fiction. Highly recommended for all Nabokov fans who as a result of reading&nbsp;this will probably wish to reread the works analyzed here</strong></p> &#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal, STARRED REVIEW</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Pitzer shows history&#x2015;if not politics&#x2015;was never far from Nabokov&#x2019;s considerations. Nabokov was, for example, an ardent enemy of anti-Semitism and a supporter of civil rights in the American South. Pitzer depicts him as fully engaged with the concerns of the world&#x2015;though he was far too courtly, too genteel, to shout his convictions from the rooftops.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Alexander Nazaryan, <em>The New Republic</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c; <p>Andrea Pitzer has given students of Nabokov a startling gift: a fundamentally new way to read one of the English language&#x2019;s preeminent prose wizards. She demolishes the false distinction between the literary gamesman we know Nabokov to be and the historically engaged writer he supposedly isn&#x2019;t. His famous characters&#x2019; psychoses, it turns out, are bound up inextricably with those of the horror-drenched century through which their creator navigated. In a feat of fascinating literary detective work, Pitzer supplies a long-overdue map of these connections.</p> &#x201d;<br> - <strong>Christopher Goffard, author of</strong> You Will See Fire and Snitch Jacket<br><br>&#x201c;<strong>In a personal note Nabokov sent to Solzhenitsyn in 1974, on the day the dissident writer was expelled from the Soviet Union, Pitzer recognizes a telling connection between two writers who shared more than most critics have realized.</strong> For beneath the consummate artifice of Nabokov&#x2019;s tales, Pitzer discerns a hidden historical vision aligned to a surprising degree with Solzhenitsyn&#x2019;s. Largely undetected, the same nightmarish world of communist brutality that Solzhenitsyn exposed in his Gulag Archipelago lies embedded in the recesses of Nabokov&#x2019;s major works, including Bend Sinister, Pnin, and Ada. The ugly historical effects of the Soviet Union&#x2019;s open-air nuclear testing lie behind otherwise puzzling features of Pale Fire. Perhaps most surprising is the presence in the depths of Nabokov&#x2019;s (in)famous Lolita of the horrific history of the Nazi death camps. Through her historically grounded readings of his fiction, Pitzer discredits the widespread but misleading perception of Nabokov as an art-for-art&#x2019;s-sake writer indifferent to the moral and political exigencies of his day. But as readers explore his devious strategies for veiling sobering historical realities in aesthetic illusions, they slowly become aware of the interpretive responsibilities that Nabokov places on the reader. <strong>A penetrating analysis certain to compel a major reassessment of the Nabokov canon.</strong> &#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist, STARRED REVIEW</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fifty years is long time to wait for a decryption device but one has been furnished by Andrea Pitzer, the author of&nbsp;<em>The Secret History of Vladimir Nabokov</em>, not just one of the most beguiling literary biographies to come out in years but also a first-rate addition to the shelf of Nabokov studies.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Daily Beast</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Secret History of Vladimir Nabokov</em> shows how the specters of history and politics&nbsp;shaped one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most important writers. In clear and bracing prose, Pitzer demonstrates the complex engagement with politics in the deepest recesses of&nbsp;Nabokov&#x2019;s most famous novels, including <em>Lolita</em> and <em>Pale Fire</em>. This book manages the impressive feat of being at once a wide-ranging introduction to Nabokov&#x2019;s life and work&nbsp;as well as a game-changer for those readers who thought they knew his writing cold.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Steven Belletto, author of</strong> No Accident, Comrade: Chance and Design in Cold War American Narrives</p><h2>Great Short Works of Herman Melville</h2><p>A rich compendium of Herman Melville's greatest short works. <i>Billy Budd</i>, <i>Sailor</i>, <i>Bartleby the Scrivener</i>, <i>Benito Cereno</i>, and the complete short stories make a rich addition to any library.</p><p><p>Herman Melville (1819-1891) was an American novelist, short story writer, essayist, and poet who received wide acclaim for his earliest novels, such as <em>Typee</em> and <em>Redburn</em>, but fell into relative obscurity by the end of his life.

There are circumstances in which, whether you partake of the tea or not&#x2014;some people of course never do,&#x2014;the situation is in itself delightful. Those that I have in mind in beginning to unfold this simple history offered an admirable setting to an innocent pastime. The implements of the little feast had been disposed upon the lawn of an old English country-house, in what I should call the perfect middle of a splendid summer afternoon. Part of the afternoon had waned, but much of it was left, and what was left was of the finest and rarest quality. Real dusk would not arrive for many hours; but the flood of summer light had begun to ebb, the air had grown mellow, the shad- ows were long upon the smooth, dense turf. They lengthened slowly, however, and the scene expressed that sense of leisure still to come which is perhaps the chief source of one&#x2019;s enjoyment of such a scene at such an hour. From five o&#x2019;clock to eight is on certain occasions a little eternity; but on such an occasion as this the interval could be only an eternity of pleasure. The persons concerned in it were taking their pleasure quietly, and they were not of the sex which is supposed to furnish the regular votaries of the ceremony I have mentioned. The shadows on the perfect lawn were straight and angular; they were the shadows of an old man sitting in a deep wicker-chair near the low table on which the tea had been served, and of two younger men strolling to and fro, in desultory talk, in front of him. The old man had his cup in his hand; it was an unusually large cup, of a different pattern from the rest of the set and painted in brilliant colours. He disposed of its contents with much circumspection, holding it for a long time close to his chin, with his face turned to the house. His companions had either finished their tea or were indifferent to their privilege; they smoked cigarettes as they continued to stroll. One of them, from time to time, as he passed, looked with a certain attention at the elder man, who, unconscious of observation, rested his eyes upon the rich red front of his dwelling. The house that rose beyond the lawn was a structure to repay such consideration and was the most characteristic object in the peculiarly English picture I have attempted to sketch.<br><br>It stood upon a low hill, above the river&#x2014;the river being the Thames at some forty miles from London. A long gabled front of red brick, with the complexion of which time and the weather had played all sorts of pictorial tricks, only, however, to improve and refine it, presented to the lawn its patches of ivy, its clustered chimneys, its windows smothered in creepers. The house had a name and a history; the old gentleman taking his tea would have been delighted to tell you these things: how it had been built under Edward the Sixth, had offered a night&#x2019;s hospitality to the great Elizabeth (whose august person had extended itself upon a huge, magnificent and terribly angular bed which still formed the principal honour of the sleeping apartments), had been a good deal bruised and defaced in Cromwell&#x2019;s wars, and then, under the Restoration, repaired and much enlarged; and how, finally, after having been remodelled and disfigured in the eighteenth century, it had passed into the careful keeping of a shrewd American banker, who had bought it originally because (owing to circumstances too complicated to set forth) it was offered at a great bargain: bought it with much grumbling at its ugliness, its antiquity, its incommodity, and who now, at the end of twenty years, had become conscious of a real ï¿½sthetic passion for it, so that he knew all its points and would tell you just where to stand to see them in combination and just the hour when the shadows of its various protuberances&#x2014;which fell so softly upon the warm, weary brickwork&#x2014;were of the right measure. Besides this, as I have said, he could have counted off most of the successive owners and occupants, several of whom were known to general fame; doing so, however, with an undemonstrative conviction that the latest phase of its destiny was not the least honourable. The front of the house overlooking that portion of the lawn with which we are concerned was not the entrance-front; this was in quite another quarter. Privacy here reigned supreme, and the wide carpet of turf that covered the level hill-top seemed but the extension of a luxurious interior. The great still oaks and beeches flung down a shade as dense as that of velvet curtains; and the place was furnished, like a room, with cushioned seats, with rich-coloured rugs, with the books and papers that lay upon the grass. The river was at some distance; where the ground began to slope the lawn, properly speaking, ceased. But it was none the less a charming walk down to the water.<br><br>The old gentleman at the tea-table, who had come from America thirty years before, had brought with him, at the top of his baggage, his American physiognomy; and he had not only brought it with him, but he had kept it in the best order, so that, if necessary, he might have taken it back to his own country with perfect confidence. At present, obviously, nevertheless, he was not likely to displace himself; his journeys were over and he was taking the rest that precedes the great rest. He had a narrow, clean-shaven face, with features evenly distributed and an expression of placid acuteness. It was evidently a face in which the range of representation was not large, so that the air of contented shrewdness was all the more of a merit. It seemed to tell that he had been successful in life, yet it seemed to tell also that his success had not been exclusive and invidious, but had had much of the inoffensiveness of failure. He had certainly had a great experience of men, but there was an almost rustic simplicity in the faint smile that played upon his lean, spacious cheek and lighted up his humorous eye as he at last slowly and carefully deposited his big tea-cup upon the table. He was neatly dressed, in well-brushed black; but a shawl was folded upon his knees, and his feet were encased in thick, embroidered slippers. A beautiful collie dog lay upon the grass near his chair, watching the master&#x2019;s face almost as tenderly as the master took in the still more magisterial physiognomy of the house; and a little bristling, bustling terrier bestowed a desultory attendance upon the other gentlemen.<br><br>One of these was a remarkably well-made man of five-and-thirty, with a face as English as that of the old gentleman I have just sketched was something else; a noticeably handsome face, fresh-coloured, fair and frank, with firm, straight features, a lively grey eye and the rich adornment of a chestnut beard. This person had a certain fortunate, brilliant exceptional look&#x2014;the air of a happy temperament fertilised by a high civilisation&#x2014;which would have made almost any observer envy him at a venture. He was booted and spurred, as if he had dismounted from a long ride; he wore a white hat, which looked too large for him; he held his two hands behind him, and in one of them&#x2014;a large, white, well-shaped fist&#x2014;was crumpled a pair of soiled dog-skin gloves.<br><br>His companion, measuring the length of the lawn beside him, was a person of quite a different pattern, who, although he might have excited grave curiosity, would not, like the other, have provoked you to wish yourself, almost blindly, in his place. Tall, lean, loosely and feebly put together, he had an ugly, sickly, witty, charming face, furnished, but by no means decorated, with a straggling moustache and whisker. He looked clever and ill&#x2014;a combination by no means felicitous; and he wore a brown velvet jacket. He carried his hands in his pockets, and there was something in the way he did it that showed the habit was inveterate. His gait had a shambling, wandering quality; he was not very firm on his legs. As I have said, whenever he passed the old man in the chair he rested his eyes upon him; and at this moment, with their faces brought into relation, you would easily have seen they were father and son. The father caught his son&#x2019;s eye at last and gave him a mild, responsive smile.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting on very well,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Have you drunk your tea?&#x201d; asked the son.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, and enjoyed it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shall I give you some more?&#x201d;<br><br>The old man considered, placidly. &#x201c;Well, I guess I&#x2019;ll wait and see.&#x201d; He had, in speaking, the American tone.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you cold?&#x201d; the son enquired.<br><br>The father slowly rubbed his legs. &#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t know. I can&#x2019;t tell till I feel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps some one might feel for you,&#x201d; said the younger man, laughing.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I hope some one will always feel for me! Don&#x2019;t you feel for me, Lord Warburton?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh yes, immensely,&#x201d; said the gentleman addressed as Lord Warburton, promptly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m bound to say you look wonderfully comfortable.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I suppose I am, in most respects.&#x201d; And the old man looked down at his green shawl and smoothed it over his knees. &#x201c;The fact is I&#x2019;ve been comfortable so many years that I suppose I&#x2019;ve got so used to it I don&#x2019;t know it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s the bore of comfort,&#x201d; said Lord Warburton. &#x201c;We only know when we&#x2019;re uncomfortable.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It strikes me we&#x2019;re rather particular,&#x201d; his companion remarked.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh yes, there&#x2019;s no doubt we&#x2019;re particular,&#x201d; Lord Warburton murmured. And then the three men remained silent a while; the two younger ones standing looking down at the other, who presently asked for more tea. &#x201c;I should think you would be very unhappy with that shawl,&#x201d; Lord Warburton resumed while his companion filled the old man&#x2019;s cup again.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh no, he must have the shawl!&#x201d; cried the gentleman in the velvet coat. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t put such ideas as that into his head.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It belongs to my wife,&#x201d; said the old man simply.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, if it&#x2019;s for sentimental reasons&#x2014;&#x201d; And Lord Warburton made a gesture of apology.<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose I must give it to her when she comes,&#x201d; the old man went on.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll please to do nothing of the kind. You&#x2019;ll keep it to cover your poor old legs.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you mustn&#x2019;t abuse my legs,&#x201d; said the old man. &#x201c;I guess they are as good as yours.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re perfectly free to abuse mine,&#x201d; his son replied, giving him his tea.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;re two lame ducks; I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s much difference.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m much obliged to you for calling me a duck. How&#x2019;s your tea?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s rather hot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s intended to be a merit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, there&#x2019;s a great deal of merit,&#x201d; murmured the old man, kindly. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a very good nurse, Lord Warburton.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t he a bit clumsy?&#x201d; asked his lordship.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh no, he&#x2019;s not clumsy&#x2014;considering that he&#x2019;s an invalid himself. He&#x2019;s a very good nurse&#x2014;for a sick-nurse. I call him my sick-nurse because he&#x2019;s sick himself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, come, daddy!&#x201d; the ugly young man exclaimed.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you are; I wish you weren&#x2019;t. But I suppose you can&#x2019;t help it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I might try: that&#x2019;s an idea,&#x201d; said the young man.<br><br>&#x201c;Were you ever sick, Lord Warburton?&#x201d; his father asked.<br><br>Lord Warburton considered a moment. &#x201c;Yes, sir, once, in the Persian Gulf.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s making light of you, daddy,&#x201d; said the other young man. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a sort of joke.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, there seem to be so many sorts now,&#x201d; daddy replied, serenely. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t look as if you had been sick, any way, Lord Warburton.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s sick of life; he was just telling me so; going on fearfully about it,&#x201d; said Lord Warburton&#x2019;s friend.<br><br>&#x201c;Is that true, sir?&#x201d; asked the old man gravely.<br><br>&#x201c;If it is, your son gave me no consolation. He&#x2019;s a wretched fel- low to talk to&#x2014;a regular cynic. He doesn&#x2019;t seem to believe in anything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s another sort of joke,&#x201d; said the person accused of cynicism.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s because his health is so poor,&#x201d; his father explained to Lord Warburton. &#x201c;It affects his mind and colours his way of looking at things; he seems to feel as if he had never had a chance. But it&#x2019;s almost entirely theoretical, you know; it doesn&#x2019;t seem to affect his spirits. I&#x2019;ve hardly ever seen him when he wasn&#x2019;t cheerful&#x2014;about as he is at present. He often cheers me up.&#x201d;<br><br>The young man so described looked at Lord Warburton and laughed. &#x201c;Is it a glowing eulogy or an accusation of levity? Should you like me to carry out my theories, daddy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;By Jove, we should see some queer things!&#x201d; cried Lord Warburton.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope you haven&#x2019;t taken up that sort of tone,&#x201d; said the old man.<br><br>&#x201c;Warburton&#x2019;s tone is worse than mine; he pretends to be bored. I&#x2019;m not in the least bored; I find life only too interesting.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, too interesting; you shouldn&#x2019;t allow it to be that, you know!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m never bored when I come here,&#x201d; said Lord Warburton. &#x201c;One gets such uncommonly good talk.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is that another sort of joke?&#x201d; asked the old man. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve no excuse for being bored anywhere. When I was your age I had never heard of such a thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You must have developed very late.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I developed very quick; that was just the reason. When I was twenty years old I was very highly developed indeed. I was working tooth and nail. You wouldn&#x2019;t be bored if you had something to do; but all you young men are too idle. You think too much of your pleasure. You&#x2019;re too fastidious, and too indolent, and too rich.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I say,&#x201d; cried Lord Warburton, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re hardly the person to accuse a fellow-creature of being too rich!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you mean because I&#x2019;m a banker?&#x201d; asked the old man.<br><br>&#x201c;Because of that, if you like; and because you have&#x2014;haven&#x2019;t you?&#x2014;such unlimited means.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He isn&#x2019;t very rich,&#x201d; the other young man mercifully pleaded. &#x201c;He has given away an immense deal of money.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I suppose it was his own,&#x201d; said Lord Warburton; &#x201c;and in that case could there be a better proof of wealth? Let not a public benefactor talk of one&#x2019;s being too fond of pleasure.&#x201d;</p><h2>Dire Predictions: Understanding Global Warming</h2><p>Used. Very Good conditions.

Dummett regards the construction of a satisfactory theory of meaning as the most pressing task of contemporary analytical philosophy. He believes that the successful completion of this difficult assignment will lead to a resolution of problems before which philosophy has been stalled, in some instances for centuries. These problems turn on the correctness or incorrectness of a realistic view of one or another realm&#x2015;the physical world, the mind, the past, mathematical reality, and so forth. Rejection of realism amounts to adoption of a variant semantics, and often of a variant logic, for the statements in a certain sector of our language. Dummett does not assume the correctness of any one logical system but shows how the choice between different logics arises at the level of the theory of meaning and depends upon the choice of one or another general form of meaning-theory. In order to determine the correct shape for a meaning-theory, we must attain a clear conception of what a meaning-theory can be expected to do. Such a conception, says Dummett, will form &#x201c;a base camp for an assault on the metaphysical peaks: I have no greater ambition in this book than to set up a base camp.&#x201d;</p><p>Michael Dummett was Wykeham Professor of Logic, Emeritus, at the University of Oxford.&#x201c;Fundamental issues of human understanding are pursued with moral passion and enormous energy by a real philosopher. The questions Dummett presses reach at least as far as the very limits of thought.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Barry Stroud</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Michael Dummett&#x2019;s <i>The Logical Basis of Metaphysics</i> was very much worth waiting for: the book is important, daring, controversial, and very deep... The overall thesis of the book is that the way to solve metaphysical problems is through philosophy of language, and the large metaphysical &#x2018;pay-off&#x2019; the book offers is nothing less than a revision of classical logic! In a nutshell, this means that the principle of Bivalence (the Law of the Excluded Middle) is wrong and Brouwer&#x2019;s Intuitionist Logic is right! Although the conclusions are dramatic, they are reached by slow and sober steps... Even though I have not been &#x2018;completely converted,&#x2019; I have myself learned an enormous amount from this book, and I believe that it marks one of the true high-water marks of twentieth-century philosophy.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Hilary Putnam, Harvard University</b><br><br>&#x201c;It will be difficult to exaggerate the philosophical interest of the general conclusion that Dummett recommends in this book. If he is right, a large number of issues which have been wrangled over inconclusively, in some cases for centuries, acquire a new sharpness and tractability, with a serious prospect (or worse) that the verdict will go against what has passed for common sense. If he is wrong, as I in fact believe, he is profoundly and importantly wrong, and it is a difficult and pressing task for philosophy to see why... [He has been urging] the general conception in articles and, in passing, in books not primarily devoted to it, for some thirty years.

Brilliant, fresh, immediate, and eloquent, these celebrated Mellon Lectures are a bravura intellectual performance. Isaiah Berlin surveys the many attempts to define romanticism, distills its essence, traces its developments from its first stirrings to its apotheosis, and shows how it still permeates our outlook. He ranges over a cast of some of the greatest thinkers and artists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including Kant, Rousseau, Diderot, Schiller, the Schlegels, Novalis, Goethe, Blake, Byron, and Beethoven. The ideas and attitudes of these and other figures, Berlin argues, helped to shape twentieth-century nationalism, existentialism, democracy, totalitarianism, and our ideas about heroic individuals, self-fulfillment, and the exalted place of art.</p><br><p> This new edition, illustrated for the first time, also features a new foreword by philosopher John Gray, in which he discusses Berlin's belief that the influence of romanticism has been unpredictable and contradictory in the extreme, fuelling anti-liberal political movements but also reinvigorating liberalism; a revised text; and a new appendix that includes some of Berlin's correspondence about the lectures and the reactions to them.</p></p><p><p>"Isaiah Berlin's Mellon Lectures on romanticism, a movement that he believed to be 'the greatest single shift in the consciousness of the West to have occurred,' are as eloquent, sprightly, and profound as anything he ever produced. This edition is provided with fascinating addenda as well as exacting editing and full references; it presents Berlin's analysis of the contradictions, plurality, and irrationality of a vital conjunction in intellectual, political, and artistic history, and restores the voice of the magus at its most thought-provoking and beguiling."<b>--Roy Foster, University of Oxford</b></p><p>"This book provides an excellent account of the topics that were to preoccupy Berlin throughout his life. . . . It is a history of ideas, wonderfully under control, always with the sense of how those ideas have impacted on other ideas and eventually on the contemporary period."<b>--Tracy B. Strong, University of California, San Diego</b></p><p>"In a dark century, he showed what a life of the mind should be: skeptical, ironical, dispassionate and free."<b>--Michael Ignatieff</b></p><b>Isaiah Berlin</b> was one of the most important philosophers of the twentieth century. A Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, he was renowned as an essayist and as the author of many books, among them <i>Karl Marx, Four Essays on Liberty, Russian Thinkers, The Sense of Reality, The Proper Study of Mankind,</i> and from Princeton, <i>Concepts and Categories, Personal Impressions, The Crooked Timber of Humanity, The Roots of Romanticism, The Power of Ideas,</i> and <i>Three Critics of the Enlightenment</i>. <b>Henry Hardy</b>, a Fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford, is one of Isaiah Berlin's literary trustees.

They are the most powerful symbols we have left of a world where human-made laws and values count for nothing; no one conquers the frozen wastelands--they merely learn to live by the rules nature dictates. It is easy to see how for a long time the lives of the polar explorers were shrouded in quasi-mystical and heroic terms. This all changed in the 1970s with the publication of Roland Huntford's magnificent biography of Scott and Amundsen, now called <i>The Last Place on Earth</i>, in which he systematically and methodically revealed the levels of incompetence and arrogance with which Scott's expedition was riddled. <p> In <i>Barrow's Boys</i> Fergus Fleming takes us on an incisive and witty journey through the landmark years of British exploration from 1816 to 1850, marveling at both the bravery and the stupidity involved. Fleming is a historian first and foremost, so he begins by placing exploration in its context. It wasn't some high-minded idealism or wacky sense of adventure, as is often suggested, that placed Britain at the forefront of discovery, but economics and self-interest. At the end of the Napoleonic wars, the British Navy was too large for its peacetime needs. Officers were laid off and advancement was slow, so the Navy needed to find itself a role. Charting the unmapped areas of the world seemed as good an idea as any. </p><p> Step forward John Barrow. Barrow was only the Second Secretary at the Admiralty--not normally a position of great influence--yet he was a skilled politician, and he managed to carve out a niche for himself by organizing expedition after expedition. He started inauspiciously by sending Captain James Tuckey off on an ill-fated jaunt up the Congo in search of "Timbuctoo," which was at that time imagined as some African El Dorado, and he ended in failure with the loss of Franklin's expedition to find the Northwest Passage. In between he courted triumph and tragedy; Ross discovered Antarctica, Parry opened up the Arctic with his attempt on the Pole, and Captain Bremer failed to establish northern Australia as the new Singapore. </p><p> Fleming has a great feel for the telling detail. He doesn't get lost in endless minutiae that distract from the narrative, but he never fails to remind us of the surrealism of British 19th-century exploration--cocked hats and reindeer-drawn sledges in the Arctic, frock coats in the Sahara. When put like this, it makes it all too easy to see how Scott could have been allowed to botch his journey to the South Pole quite so catastrophically. <i>--John Crace, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Fergus Fleming was born in 1959 and studied at Oxford University and City University, London. He trained as an accountant and barrister and has worked as a furniture maker.</p><h2>Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning: Volume II Patterns of Plausible Inference (Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning, 2)</h2><p>Here the author of How to Solve It explains how to become a &#34;good guesser.&#34; Marked by G.

The material in both volumes is fresh and highly original; the presentation is stimulating, informal, and occasionally humorous; examples from science, legal reasoning, and daily life make the arguments clear even to a nonspecialist. Polya's book is a rare event."<b>---Morris Kline, <i>Scientific American</i></b><br><br>"Professor Polya presents a forceful argument for the teaching of intelligent guessing as well as proving. . . .

The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends--and much trouble--her way. Not a day goes by without some melodramatic new episode in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on, Anne declares her eternal antipathy for Gilbert Blythe, a classmate who commits the ultimate sin of mocking her hair color. Later, she accidentally dyes that same cursed hair green. Another time, in her haste to impress a new neighbor, she bakes a cake with liniment instead of vanilla. Lucy Maud Montgomery's series of books about Anne have remained classics since the early 20th century. Her portrayal of this feminine yet independent spirit has given generations of girls a strong female role model, while offering a taste of another, milder time in history. This lovely boxed gift collection comprises <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>, <i>Anne of the Island</i>, <i>Anne of Avonlea</i>, <i>Anne of Windy Poplars</i>, <i>Anne's House of Dreams</i>, <i>Anne of Ingleside</i>, <i>Rainbow Valley</i>, and <i>Rilla of Ingleside</i>.

As Dr Sherry Rogers explains, `The road to good health is paved with good intestines!&#39; Her books explain in a very easy to understand manner how to deal with the causes of disease using cutting edge medical knowledge, technology and testing, and not just how to mask symptoms with drugs and other superficial treatments (which lead to worsening problems in other areas of health). As Dr Sherry Rogers writes :`I have to laugh when people ask me if I do alternative, herbal, acupuncture or holistic medicine. &#39;No,&#39; I reply. &#39;We do state-of-the-art medicine. In other words, we find the biochemical, nutritional and environmental causes and cures rather than blindly drugging everything. Sure, herbs are gentler, safer and more physiologic than drugs and holistic medicine attempts to incorporate many diverse modalities, etc. But there is no substitute for finding the underlying biochemical causes and cures. This is real medicine. This is where medicine should and would have been decades ago, if it had not been abducted by the pharmaceutical industry.&#39;</p><p></p><h2>Memoirs of a Soldier, Nurse, and Spy: A Woman&#39;s Adventures in the Union Army</h2><p><p>Among the hundreds of women who, in disguise, enlisted to serve as men during the Civil War, only Sarah Edmonds is known to have written a memoir recounting her experiences. As "Franklin Thompson," she joined the 2nd Michigan Infantry Regiment in 1861, then fought in some of the bloodiest struggles of the Civil War, from the first battle of Bull Run to the Kentucky Campaign of 1863. <br> <br>This daring woman embarked upon dangerous missions into Confederate territory to gather information and to survey enemy positions, sometimes in the guise of a slave or Irish washerwoman, sometimes in Confederate uniform. Through her experiences as a "male nurse" and Union soldier, Edmonds depicts the horrors of Civil War hospitals and the simple pastimes of camp life. Throughout her impassioned account, first published in 1865, this enthralling storyteller reveals her courage, dedication to the Union, and resourcefulness in concealing her identity. <br> <br>Three years after her death, Edmonds's body was reinterred with military honors by her comrades, who recognized in her a "strong, healthy, and robust soldier, ever willing and ready for duty." The introduction and annotations by Elizabeth D. Leonard, a leading authority on Civil War women, support and amplify Edmonds's account. Challenging established views of the Civil War soldier, Memoirs of a Soldier, Nurse, and Spy is compelling reading, especially for those interested in the Civil War, women's history, American studies, and military history.</p></p><p><p>"An extraordinary story for any war's retelling.... Elizabeth Leonard, the leading authority on women in the Civil War armies, has provided excellent editorial notes and has pieced Edmonds's story together in admirable fashion."&#x2014;<i>The Historian</i></p><p>"Fascinating.... Sarah Edmonds's memoir is not to be missed."&#x2014;<i>Michigan Historical Review</i></p><p>"Great fun to read."&#x2014;<i>Civil War Courier</i></p></p><h2>Introduction to Matrix Computations (Computer Science and Applied Mathematics)</h2><p>Numerical linear algebra is far too broad a subject to treat in a single introductory volume. Stewart has chosen to treat algorithms for solving linear systems, linear least squares problems, and eigenvalue problems involving matrices whose elements can all be contained in the high-speed storage of a computer. By way of theory, the author has chosen to discuss the theory of norms and perturbation theory for linear systems and for the algebraic eigenvalue problem. These choices exclude, among other things, the solution of large sparse linear systems by direct and iterative methods, linear programming, and the useful Perron-Frobenious theory and its extensions. However, a person who has fully mastered the material in this book should be well prepared for independent study in other areas of numerical linear algebra.</p><p>"The material presented here bridges the gap between the usual treatment of abstract vector spaces and the matrix theory with which a modern numerical analyst must be familiar in a way that should meet with widespread approval. Few books on numerical analysis have given me as much satisfaction as did this. It has perfect balance in an age where this quality is becoming increasingly rare."<br>--James H.

Many people, of course, realize that liberalism no longer connotes distributed powers and bourgeois moral standards, the need to protect civil society from an encroaching state, or the virtues of vigorous self-government. Many also know that today's "liberals" have far different goals from those of their predecessors, aiming as they do largely to combat prejudice, to provide social services and welfare benefits, and to defend expressive and "lifestyle" freedoms. Paul Gottfried does more than analyze these historical facts, however. He builds on them to show why it matters that the managerial state has replaced traditional liberalism: the new regimes of social engineers, he maintains, are elitists, and their rule is consensual only in the sense that it is unopposed by any widespread organized opposition.</p><br><p> Throughout the western world, increasingly uprooted populations unthinkingly accept centralized controls in exchange for a variety of entitlements. In their frightening passivity, Gottfried locates the quandary for traditionalist and populist adversaries of the welfare state. How can opponents of administrative elites show the public that those who provide, however ineptly, for their material needs are the enemies of democratic self-rule and of independent decision making in family life? If we do not wake up, Gottfried warns, the political debate may soon be over, despite sporadic and ideologically confused populist rumblings in both Europe and the United States.</p></p><p><p>"Although I disagree with the author on many of his points, I strongly recommend it. Gottfried's thesis is refreshingly novel, strongly advanced, and clearly presented. Whether one is interested in the future of the welfare state or family values, or the economic and social future of America, this is a book one wishes to read."<b>--Amitai Etzioni, author of <i>The New Golden Rule</i></b></p><p>"This brilliant and disquieting book should reshape current debates and be essential reading for all who seek to understand them."<b>--Elizabeth Fox-Genovese</b></p><p>"This thoughtful work reflects the intellectual qualities of an erudite political philosopher whose knowledge of European political philosophy in the twentieth century is particularly impressive."<b>--John Lukacs</b></p><b>Paul Edward Gottfried</b> is Professor of Humanities at Elizabethtown College and author of, among other books, <i>Carl Schmitt: Politics and Theory, The Search for Historical Meaning;</i> and <i>The Conservative Movement.</i> Editor in chief of <i>This World,</i> he is also a senior editor of <i>Telos</i> and a contributing editor to <i>Chronicles</i> and <i>Humanitas.</i></p><h2>Business Development For Dummies</h2><p><b>Growing a small business requires more than just sales</b> <p><i>Business Development For Dummies</i> helps maximise the growth of small- or medium-sized businesses, with a step-by-step model for business development designed specifically for B2B or B2C service firms.

No matter the model or year, one can instantly pick out a &#x2019;Vette&#x2014;from the four chrome-ringed headlamps of the late-1950s models to the sharp edges of the 1960s Sting Ray, the signature curved wheel-well moldings on 1970s bodies, and up to the aggressive aerodynamics of the Corvette C6. But while all are undeniably beautiful machines, none approach the astonishing technology packed into Chevrolet&#x2019;s latest: the seventh-generation 2014 Corvette Stingray, which marks the historic resurgence of the Stingray badge for the first time since the mid-1970s. In <i>The Complete Book of Corvette</i>, American automotive expert Mike Mueller details all of the generations, offering the definitive, all-encompassing volume showcasing over 60 years of Corvette history. Created in cooperation with General Motors and illustrated with 500 color and black-and-white photos from GM&#x2019;s exclusive Design and Media Archives, the book highlights the development, tech specs, and visual prowess of the entire Corvette line. From that first 1953 &#x2019;Vette to the brand-new 2014 Corvette Stingray&#x2014;the triumphant culmination of Chevrolet&#x2019;s longstanding sports car expertise&#x2014;<i>The Complete Book of Corvette</i> pays tribute to one of America&#x2019;s proudest sports car traditions and the innovative company behind it.</p><p><br> <p><b></b></p> <b>The Complete Book of Corvette</b> <p></p> <p>Form truly followed function as each aesthetically pleasing crease and scoop played its part to make the 2014 Stingray the slickest, most slippery &#x2019;Vette yet. &#x201c;Every square inch of the 2014 Corvette&#x2019;s exterior is designed to enhance high-performance driving,&#x201d; claimed exterior design manager Kirk Bennion. &#x201c;The team delivered a great balance of low drag for efficiency and performance elements for improved stability and track capability&#x2014;all in a sculpted design that excites in all the ways that a Corvette has for six decades. &#x201d;</p> Upgrading the cockpit was a prime goal with the 2014 Stingray. Prototypes were disguised to keep prying public eyes at bay when the car was tested on the street. Every aspect of the 2014 Stingray was designed for aesthetic beauty and high-speed performance. A preproduction Stingray coupe became the 12th Corvette to pace the Indy 500 in May 2013. The finalized Stingray design was first sculpted into a full-size clay model. 300 GM designers from around the world submitted their vision of the 2014 Stingray. <p>What a long, strange trip it&#x2019;s been.

Why dilly-dally when even better times lay ahead? Two years later, Chief Engineer David Hill&#x2019;s team took what was already America&#x2019;s supreme performance machine and transformed it into one of the planet&#x2019;s greatest. Standard performance now qualified as downright surreal: 0&#x2013;60 in 4.2 seconds and a top end of 186 miles per hour. What a long, strange trip it&#x2019;s been. Nearly cancelled a few years after its birth, rumored near death or dilution more than one time since, Chevy&#x2019;s fantastic, plastic two-seater is rolling on more confidently than ever, this after six distinct generations of development. Code names for those generations came into vogue during the radically redesigned 1997 Corvette&#x2019;s long haul to market after Chevrolet people let it be known that this all-new platform was identified in-house by the simple &#x201c;C5&#x201d; designation. It was only logical to retroactively label previous generations accordingly: Original solid-axle models built from 1953 to 1962 made up the C1 group; the C2 family consisted of the classic Sting Rays of 1963 to 1967; the C3 era spanned from 1968 to 1982; and the C4 ran from 1984 to 1996. (Chevrolet skipped the 1983 model year, as fourth-generation development work ran past its deadline.) The fifth-generation Corvette was initially targeted for introduction in August 1992, just in time to help commemorate the Corvette&#x2019;s 40th anniversary. But various pitfalls pushed that debut back repeatedly, first for the 1994 model year, then 1995. When all was said and done, the long-awaited C5 officially appeared in January 1997. The latest rendition, the expectedly tabbed C6, followed eight years later to take the Corvette legacy to all-new heights. <b></b>&nbsp; <b></b>&nbsp;</p><h2>Community Psychology: In Pursuit of Liberation and Well-being</h2><p><p>In its broadest sense, community psychology studies the individual's relationships to their community and to wider society. Sitting at the junction between social and clinical psychology, and heavily influenced by activist traditions in political science, sociology and social work, this powerfully written book delivers a comprehensive introduction to the definition and aims of this justice-orientated field of psychology. Editors Nelson and Prilleltensky cover a broad range of the critical perspectives and fundamental values that define the aims of community psychology, highlighting the psychosocial praxis that these have produced and the key political and societal ills that they aim to prevent. Written with a global perspective, this book exhibits internationally authored chapters as well as in-text commentators and cross-cultural case studies. This book is a key guide to understanding how community psychologists function to resolve structural injustice and bring about transformative change to the socio-economic issues of our time such as homelessness, mental health, racism, discrimination and marginalisation.</p> <p>This text can be used as an essential guide for undergraduate students beginning courses in Community Psychology as it presents a thorough history of the field, a rigorous breakdown of the various socio-economic issues at the heart of community psychology&#x2019;s focus, as well as a critical analysis of methods of intervention and research.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br></p><p>The second edition of this introductory textbook, Community Psychology, has been updated and expanded to reflect how changes within society have led to developments across the field.<br>The authors offer a fascinating introduction for students, setting out the principles of community psychology as they consider how its roots have helped to shape the goals of liberation and well-being.

The 2010 original has been described as a &#x201c;Flintstones&#x201d; take economics that entertainingly explains the beauty of free markets. The new edition has been greatly expanded in both quantity and quality. A new introduction and two new illustrated chapters bring the story up to date, and most importantly, the book makes the jump from black and white to full and vivid color.</p> <p>With the help of colorful cartoon illustrations, lively humor, and deceptively simple storytelling, the Schiff's bring the complex subjects of inflation, monetary policy, recession, and other important topics in economics down to Earth. The story starts with three guys on an island who barely survive by fishing barehanded. Then one enterprising islander invents a net, catches more fish, and changes the island&#x2019;s economy fundamentally. Using this story the Schiffs apply their signature take-no-prisoners logic to expose the glaring fallacies and gaping holes permeating the global economic conversation. The Collector&#x2019;s Edition:</p> <ul> <li>Provides straight answers about how economies work, without relying on nonsensical jargon and mind-numbing doublespeak the experts use to cover up their confusion</li> <li>Includes a new introduction that sets the stage for developing a deeper, more practical understanding of inflation and the abuses of the monetary system</li> <li>Adds two new chapters that dissect the Federal Reserve&#x2019;s Quantitative easing policies and the European Debt Crisis. &nbsp;</li> <li>Colorizes the original book's hundreds of cartoon illustrations. The improved images, executed by artist Brendan Leach from the original book, add new vigor to the presentation</li> <li>Has a larger format that has been designed to fit most coffee tables. &nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>While the story may appear simple on the surface, as told by the Schiff brothers, it will leave you with a deep understanding of <i>How an Economy Grows and Why It Crashes</i>.</p></p><p><p>If you don't have your facts straight, explaining how an economy works can be like trying to catch brook trout with your bare hands. Watching the parade of self-appointed "experts" twist logic into pretzels in order to make useless economic forecasts is enough to make the average person change the channel. Could it be that the talking heads don't have a clue? Is it possible that the "dismal science," as economics has become known, is neither as complicated nor as dismal as you've been led to believe?</p> <p>According to the authors of this thoroughly entertaining introduction to economics, the answer is a resounding "Yes!" It's all a matter of where you start and how you tell the tale.</p> <p>In this expanded and colorized <i>Collector's Edition</i> of their award-winning book <i>How an Economy Grows and Why It Crashes</i>, Peter Schiff, economic expert and bestselling author of <i>Crash Proof</i>, <i>The Little Book of Bull Moves</i>, and <i>The Real Crash</i>, once again teams up with brother Andrew Schiff to shed light on economic mysteries with an informative and extremely amusing allegory. The Schiffs' story takes place on a tropical island where hunter-gatherer cavemen struggle daily to catch fish for their basic survival. As the island economy develops and becomes increasingly dynamic, layer upon layer of institutions and government entities spring up to protect the islanders' savings and assets, leading to ever-increasing levels of complexity. But, at the core, the economic engines remain the same.</p> <p>Served up with lavish portions of wit--and a super-sized helping of common sense on the side--the Schiffs deftly explain many widely misunderstood aspects of economics, including the root causes of growth, the uses of capital, the destructive nature of consumer credit, the causes of inflation and deflation, and many others.</p> <p>The book is an expansion and update of the celebrated cartoon book written in the early 1980s by the Schiffs' father Irwin, a renowned economist and forecaster in his own right. For this <i>Collector's Edition</i>, all of the book's existing illustrations (by graphic artist Brendan Leach) have been vibrantly colorized, and two new chapters (with new illustrations) have been added that wryly comment on recent economic developments. This edition also features a new introduction, in which the authors reflect on the dangers presented by the ever increasing reliance on expansive monetary policy.</p> <p>A book that proves that economics can be much easier to wrap your head around than you ever imagined--not to mention rousing good fun--<i>How an Economy Grows and Why It Crashes, Collector's Edition</i> gives you the straight answers you've always craved and spares you the mind-numbing doublespeak that experts have used to cover up their own cluelessness.</p><p>"If you feel you want to get a decent grasp of free-market economics . . . this book is the perfect place to start."<br> <b>&#x2015;Daniel Hannan, Telegraph.co.uk</b></p> <p>"<i>How an Economy Grows and Why It Crashes</i> makes economics fun and accessible.

Having spent the first part of the term doing mostly computational work, they are unprepared for the rigors of conceptual thinking in an abstract setting that is frequently the focus of the second half of the course.&nbsp;Holt's <i>Linear Algebra with Applications </i>blends computational and conceptual topics throughout. Early treatment of conceptual topics in the context of Euclidean space gives students more time, and a familiar setting, in which to absorb them. This organization also makes it possible to treat eigenvalues and eigenvectors earlier than in most texts. Abstract vector spaces are introduced later, once students have developed a solid conceptual foundation.&nbsp;Concepts and topics are frequently accompanied by applications to provide context and motivation. Because many students learn by example, <i>Linear Algebra with Applications</i> provides a large number of representative examples, over and above those used to introduce topics. The text also has over 2500 exercises, covering computational and conceptual topics over a range of difficulty levels.</p><p>JEFFREY HOLT, University of Virginia, USA.</p><h2>Mimosa</h2><p>This child of an Indian village, from a Hindu family and background, heard one afternoon about a God who loved her, and lived from then on under His influence, surmounting every kind of opposition and adversity.

On 8 June 1952 the United States Supreme Court invalidated Truman&#x2019;s order with its monumental decision in <i>Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. v. Sawyer</i>. The history and significance of this case constitute the subject of Maeva Marcus&#x2019;s meticulously researched, brilliantly analyzed, and authoritative study. From Truman&#x2019;s initial assertion of "inherent" executive power under the Constitution to the High Court&#x2019;s seven opinions, Marcus assesses the influence of the case on the doctrine of separation of powers and, specifically, the nature and practice of executive authority. First published in 1977 (Columbia University Press), and reissued here in paperback with a new foreword by Louis Fisher, this book remains the definitive account of the Steel Seizure incident and its political and legal ramifications.</p><p>&#34;Although there have been some other articles and books on the &#34;Youngstown&#34; case, this book remains definitive. The author handles a variety of materials exceedingly well, and shows great sensitivity not only to the legal issues involved, but to the political ones as well.

From 1910 to 1940, the center of <i>Drosophila</i> culture in America was the school of Thomas Hunt Morgan and his students Alfred Sturtevant and Calvin Bridges. They first created "standard" flies through inbreeding and by organizing a network for exchanging stocks of flies that spread their practices around the world.<br> <br> In <i>Lords of the Fly,</i> Robert E. Kohler argues that fly laboratories are a special kind of ecological niche in which the wild fruit fly is transformed into an artificial animal with a distinctive natural history. He shows that the fly was essentially a laboratory tool whose startling productivity opened many new lines of genetic research. Kohler also explores the moral economy of the "Drosophilists": the rules for regulating access to research tools, allocating credit for achievements, and transferring authority from one generation of scientists to the next.<br> <br> By closely examining the Drosophilists' culture and customs, Kohler reveals essential features of how experimental scientists do their work.</p></p><p>"Kohler's study is a pioneering and provocative one, as he reveals just how important experimental skills and practices have been to the development of twentieth-century genetics. His contribution is a welcome alternative to static accounts of theory overpowering all aspects of experimental life. . . . Kohler's text will surely find its place among the most important books in the history of biology."&lt;\#209&gt;Myles W. Jackson, <br><i>Journal of Modern History</i><i> (Myles W.

The top management at Toyosan Motors must decide whether to begin offshore production of its cars in the U.S. But our hero Mr. Kudo fears that offshore production will devastate the numerous local subcontractors of Toyosan, leading to a hollowing out of the auto industry in Japan, leaving only a financial shell. The American color TV industry has already suffered such a fate. The villain, Mr. Tsugawa, calls Kudo a wimp and sees a splendid opportunity for union busting. Will our hero prevail?<br><br>Thus begins the first episode of this rollicking yet incisive introduction to the world economy from the Japanese point of view. Other episodes treat the appreciation of the yen, the impact of the 1970s oil shocks, deficit financing, the internationalization of business and banking, and the post-industrial future of Japan and the Pacific Rim.<br><br>The book is an English edition of volume 1 of <i>Manga Nihon keizai nyumon</i>, originally published in 1986 by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the Japanese equivalent of the <i>Wall Street Journal.</i> It is based on a serious introductory text put out by the newspaper and is packed with informative charts and facts. When the comic book was first published in Japan, it was an immediate best-seller, selling over 550,000 copies in less than a year.<br><br>The stories in the book reflect Japan's national mood during the "Japanese miracle" and into the 1980s economic bubble: apprehension and optimism jostle one another, and there is a sense of national self-pity. The book also reflects a deep suspicion of politics and bureaucrats. The prime minister appears more worried about his government's popularity than about taking the right economic course. Ultimately, the employees at Toyosan Motors demonstrate that the success of the Japanese economy will not depend on natural resources or politics but on business practices that are ethical, socially responsible, and forward-looking.</p><p>"Both entertaining and a splendid introduction to the country's economic problems."&#x2014;Chalmers Johnson<b>Shotaro Ishinomori</b> (previously Shotaro Ishimori) is one of Japan's all-star comic strip artists.

When the Romans conquered Egypt, it was really Egypt that conquered the Romans. Cleopatra captivated both Caesar and Marc Antony and soon Roman ladies were worshipping Isis and wearing vials of Nile water around their necks. What is it about ancient Egypt that breeds such obsession and imitation? <i>Egyptomania </i>explores the burning fascination with all things Egyptian and the events that fanned the flames--from ancient times, to Napoleon's Egyptian campaign, to the discovery of Tutankhamen's tomb by Howard Carter in the 1920s. For forty years, Bob Brier, one of the world's foremost Egyptologists, has been amassing one of the largest collections of Egyptian memorabilia&nbsp;and seeking to understand the pull of Ancient Egypt on our world today. In this original and groundbreaking book, with twenty-four pages of color photos from the author's collection, he explores our three-thousand-year-old fixation with recovering Egyptian culture and its meaning. He traces our enthrallment with the mummies that seem to have cheated death and the pyramids that as if they will last forever. Drawing on his personal collection--from Napoleon's twenty volume Egypt encyclopedia&nbsp;to Howard Carter's letters written from the Valley of the Kings as he was excavating--this is an inventive and mesmerizing tour of how an ancient civilization endures in ours today.</p><p>Bob Brier, known as Mr. Mummy, is a Senior Research Fellow at Long Island University/LIU Post and the author of eight books, including <i>The Murder of Tutankhamen.</i> He has conducted pioneering research in mummification practices and has investigated some of the world's most famous mummies, including King Tut, Lenin, Ramses the Great, Evita, and the Medici family of Renaissance Italy. He has conducted research in pyramids and tombs in 15 countries and was the host of several award-winning television specials for TLC, including the blockbuster series <i>Pyramids, Mummies &amp; Tombs </i>and <i>Mummy Detective</i>. In 2010 National Geographic TV presented his documentary "Secret of the Great Pyramid." A contributing editor to <i>Archaeology Magazine</i>, he also writes articles for many other magazines, including <i>Smithsonian, and KMT. </i>He lives in the Bronx, NY.<p>&#x201c;Mr. Brier is proficient at elucidating Egyptology, and his passion is so sincere and good-humored that his book is rather charming.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Egyptomania does a good job of tracing the chronology with which Egypt fever caught on.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;A lively account combining history and popular culture with guidelines for possible future collectors.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;Obelisk-envy, international politics, psychology and the mania generated by the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb all appear, broken into readable chunks by amusing subheadings and illustrations.

Bob Brier's always entertaining style keeps the pace moving, yet manages to inform and educate with historical context as well. Not many scholars today can write with equal comfort about Napoleon's invasion and King Tut's Party Mix, the harrowing tale of towing an obelisk to London and &#x2018;Cleopatra had a Jazz Band'.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Peter Der Manuelian, Philip J.

From its engaging forward by none other than Egypt's premier archaeologist, Zahi Hawass to its discussion of the "King Tut" exhibition, Egyptomania chronicles every aspect of the subject including cigarette packs, Boris Karloff and the thrilling and sometimes harrowing efforts to move the great obelisks.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Dr. Peter Lacovara, Senior Curator, Carlos Museum, Emory University</i></p></p><h2>DeGowin&#39;s Diagnostic Examination, Ninth Edition</h2><p><p><b>The classic point-of-care guide to the undifferentiated patient -- completely revised and easier to navigate than ever!</b></p> <p><b>A Doody's Core Title for 2011!</b></p> <p><b>5 STAR DOODY'S REVIEW!</b><br> "DeGowin's is considered one of the first books on diagnosis, and the one most physicians trained in the last 40 years grew up with.

To protect himself and those he loved, Andre started pumping iron and learned to use his fists so well that he became the kind of man who could send others to the hospital with one punch, and did. Irresistibly drawn to stand up for the underdog, he was on a fast track to getting killed&#x2015;or killing someone else.<br><br> Nearby, his father, an eminent author, taught on a college campus and took the kids out on Sundays. The clash of worlds between town and gown, between the hard drinking, drugging, and fighting of &#x201c;townies&#x201d; and the ambitions of well-fed students debating books and ideas, couldn&#x2019;t have been more stark or more difficult for a son to communicate to a father. Only by finally putting pen to paper himself did young Andre come into his own, discovering the power of empathy in channeling the stories of others&#x2015;and ultimately bridging the rift between his father and himself.<br><br> An unforgettable book, <em>Townie</em> is a riveting and profound meditation on physical violence and the failures and triumphs of love.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, February 2011</strong>: Rarely has the process of becoming a writer seemed as organic and--dare I say it--moral as it does in Andre Dubus III's clear-eyed and compassionate memoir, <em>Townie</em>. You might think that following his father's trade would have been natural and even obvious for the son and namesake of Andre Dubus, one of the most admired short story writers of his time, but it was anything but. His father left when he was 10, and as his mother worked long hours to keep them fed, her four children mostly raised themselves, stumbling through house parties and street fights in their Massachusetts mill town, so cut off from the larger world that when someone mentioned "Manhattan" when Andre was in college he didn't know what they were talking about. What he did know, and what he recalls with detailed intensity, were the battles in bars and front yards, brutal to men and women alike, that first gave him discipline, as he built himself from a fearful kid into a first-punch, hair-trigger bruiser, and then empathy, as, miraculously, he pulled himself back from the violence that threatened to define him. And it was out of that empathy that, wanting to understand the stories of the victims of brutality as well as those whose pain drove them to dish it out, he began to write, reconciling with his father and eventually giving us novels like <em>House of Sand and Fog</em> and now this powerful and big-hearted memoir. <em>--Tom Nissley</em>Andre Dubus III is the author of Gone So Long, Dirty Love, The Garden of Last Days, House of Sand and Fog (a #1 New York Times bestseller, Oprah&#x2019;s Book Club pick, and finalist for the National Book Award), and Townie, winner of an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Literature. His writing has received many honors, including a Guggenheim Fellowship, a National Magazine Award, and two Pushcart Prizes.

New York: Capital of Photography examines how photographers chronicled New York throughout the twentieth century, how the city changed their vision, and how their work affected ideas about New York throughout the world. This beautifully illustrated book presents the work of both famous and lesser-known photographers, many of them Jewish. An underlying theme in this pictorial history of New York is the critical role played by Jewish sensibility. Max Kozloff begins with the development of street photography that emerged in New York in the early 1900s with a local school of photographers led by Alfred Stieglitz. Documenting work, loneliness, play, conflict, love, and spectacle, this group came to define urban perception as the characteristic visual experience of modernity. Some photographers also became social activists, observing New York&#39;s ethnic and racial diversity and focusing their lenses on newcomers and marginalized groups. From the 1930s to 1960s, Kozloff shows, members of the New York School envisioned the city in a different way, as a processing center for immigrants, a site of commercial display, and a crossroads of world culture. In the 1950s and 1960s, photographers saw New York as an uneasy battleground, and their pictures caught the forces of civil rights, sexual liberation, and leftist politics as they clashed with traditional powers. Finally, as the century waned, photographers became more self-conscious, exploring their own and their friends&#39; identities through the camera&#39;s eye. From Lewis Hine&#39;s 1905 picture of recent immigrants at Ellis Island to Nan Goldin&#39;s portraits of her friends over the past thirty years, these photographs reveal the true vitality of New York. The book accompanies an exhibition at The Jewish Museum, New York, from April 28 to September 2, 2002.</p><p>The book accompanies an exhibition which will be at The Jewish Museum, New York, from April 28 to September 2, 2002 and then at the Madison Art Center in Madison Wisconsin from December 7, 2002 to February 16, 2003.

The billionaire owners of Hobby Lobby, a huge nationwide chain of craft stores, the Greens came to national attention in 2014 after successfully suing the federal government over their religious objections to provisions of the Affordable Care Act. What is less widely known is that the Greens are now America&#x2019;s biggest financial supporters of Christian causes&#x2015;and they are spending hundreds of millions of dollars in an ambitious effort to increase the Bible&#x2019;s influence on American society. In <i>Bible Nation</i>, Candida Moss and Joel Baden provide the first in-depth investigative account of the Greens&#x2019; sweeping Bible projects and the many questions they raise.</p><p><i>Bible Nation</i> tells the story of the Greens&#x2019; rapid acquisition of an unparalleled collection of biblical antiquities; their creation of a closely controlled group of scholars to study and promote their collection; their efforts to place a Bible curriculum in public schools; and their construction of a $500 million Museum of the Bible near the National Mall in Washington, D.C. <i>Bible Nation</i> reveals how these seemingly disparate initiatives promote a very particular set of beliefs about the Bible&#x2015;and raise serious ethical questions about the trade in biblical antiquities, the integrity of academic research, and more.</p><p><i>Bible Nation</i> is an important and timely account of how a vast private fortune is being used to promote personal faith in the public sphere&#x2015;and why it should matter to everyone.</p></p><p><p>"Absolutely riveting. Without exaggeration, this is one of the most interesting books I have read in years. Moss and Baden have embedded a searing indictment within a compelling detective story that ranges from academic intrigue to divinely inspired business acumen, with a driving narrative and a cast of characters worthy of Hollywood, except that this is real life. <i>Bible Nation</i> should be required reading for anyone even thinking of visiting the Museum of the Bible."<b>--Eric H. Cline, author of <i>Three Stones Make a Wall: The Story of Archaeology</i></b></p><p>"Moss and Baden's account of how a family of billionaires has almost single--handedly transformed the American religious landscape&#x2014;to the benefit of some and the detriment of many&#x2014;will shake you to your core. This is a must read in our increasingly polarized country."<b>--Reza Aslan, author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth</i></b></p><p>"<i>Bible Nation</i> offers a vivid tour through the catacombs of the culture wars: the unexpected political and theological battles in education policy, museum administration, and even the secretive world of international traders who buy and sell ancient manuscripts. Part cultural study, part family biography, part detective story, this book demonstrates that the Green family has accrued immense influence over the politics of religious liberty and the bounds of academic freedom in the study of the Bible."<b>--Molly Worthen, author of <i>Apostles of Reason: The Crisis of Authority in American Evangelicalism</i></b></p><p>"An intimate look at conservative Christianity and its biblical worldview. Riveting and disturbing."<b>--T. M. Luhrmann, author of <i>When God Talks Back: Understanding the American Evangelical Relationship with God</i></b></p><p>"<i>Bible Nation</i> is a deft and insightful portrait of pious evangelicals who are utterly convinced of their beliefs&#x2014;and unable to see them in any kind of critical light. At the very least, the naivetï¿½ is deeply detrimental to biblical scholarship and to a thoughtful public comprehension of the Bible. <i>Bible Nation</i> is an important addition to the understanding of contemporary evangelicalism."<b>--Margaret Bendroth, author of <i>The Last Puritans: Mainline Protestants and the Power of the Past</i></b></p><p>"Engaging and timely, <i>Bible Nation</i> is a compelling account of the efforts of the family that owns Hobby Lobby to tell a particular story about the Bible and its role in history. The authors have done a terrific investigative job to show how problematic the foundations of the whole enterprise are, making the case that it is dangerous in its ethical evasions, its privileging of the &#x2018;story' over the evidence, and its undermining of professional scholarly norms."<b>--Elizabeth A.

Part One focuses on the exponential technologies that are disrupting today&#x2019;s Fortune 500 companies and enabling upstart entrepreneurs to go from &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got an idea&#x201d; to &#x201c;I run a billion-dollar company&#x201d; far faster than ever before. The authors provide exceptional insight into the power of 3D printing, artificial intelligence, robotics, networks and sensors, and synthetic biology. Part Two draws on insights from billionaires such as Larry Page, Elon Musk, Richard Branson, and Jeff Bezos and reveals their entrepreneurial secrets. Finally, <i>Bold</i> closes with a look at the best practices that allow anyone to leverage today&#x2019;s hyper-connected crowd like never before. Here, the authors teach how to design and use incentive competitions, launch million-dollar crowdfunding campaigns to tap into tens of billions of dollars of capital, and finally how to build communities&#x2014;armies of exponentially enabled individuals willing and able to help today&#x2019;s entrepreneurs make their boldest dreams come true.</p><p>Peter H.

Often, though, we go through the motions at Mass without an appreciation for what has really happened. Popular speaker and author Mark Hart helps Catholics move beyond the repetition and ritual to see the Mass for what it really is: a heavenly banquet, a wedding feast, in which heaven and earth meet. In his engaging style, Hart guides readers toward a deeper understanding of the Mass its roots in the Jewish Sabbath, its sacrificial character, and its signs and symbols. As we are told to go in peace, he inspires us to see the Mass as a place to be nourished so that we can further Christ s mission in the world. <p> In the last part of the book, Hart provides pithy answers to frequently asked questions, such as Why can t I leave right after Communion? or Why did the words change? Finally, Hart offers ten things we can do to get more out of Mass.</p></p><p>Mark Hart is executive vice president for Life Teen International as well as an award-winning author, a popular speaker, and the host of the SiriusXM Catholic radio show Fired Up!

Schmidt&#x2019;s rare vision is a journey into many literary worlds. First and foremost it is about Edgar Allan Poe, or perhaps it is language itself that plays that lead role; and it is certainly about sex in its many Freudian disguises, but about love as well, whether fragile and unfulfilled or crude and wedded. As befits a dream upon a heath populated by elemental spirits, the shapes and figures are protean, its protagonists suddenly transformed into trees, horses, and demigods. In a single day, from one midsummer dawn to a fiery second, Dan and Franzisca, Wilma and Paul explore the labyrinths of literary creation and of their own dreams and desires.</p> <p>Since its publication in 1970 <i>Zettel&#x2019;s Traum/Bottom&#x2019;s Dream</i> has been regarded as Arno Schimdt&#x2019;s magnum opus, as the definitive work of a titan of postwar German literature. Readers are now invited to explore its verbally provocative landscape in an English translation by John E. Woods.</p></p><p>Arno Schmidt (1914&#x2013;1979) was born in the working-class suburb of Hamburg-Hamm, Germany. Drafted into the army in 1940, he served in the artillery at a flak base in Norway until the end of the war. After being held as a prisoner of war for eight months, he worked briefly as an interpreter for the British military police. His first book, <i>Leviathan</i>, was published in 1949. In 1958 Schmidt moved to the village of Bargfeld near Celle. Over the next twenty years, until his death, he wrote some of the landmarks of postwar German literature, many of which are available in translation from Dalkey Archive Press."Arno Schmidt . . . was an enormously important talent in the fictional line of cruel comedy that runs from Rabelais through Swift and Joyce&#x2015;or to say it straight out: a major European novelist." -<i>New York Review of Books</i><br><br>"(A) treasure house of post-Joycean language-games, the projection of a complex and crotchety personality, a unique blend of fiction, conversation pieces and literary criticism, humorous and obsessed, intellectually adventurous and stuffily provincial, polyglot and archetypically German" -S. S. Prawer, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br>". . . In this world, as he writes, everything proves to be a "PHALIBILD . . . NOTHING BUT A PENIDIN." These elusive etyms are perhaps the true heroes of Schmidt's masterpiece, <i>Bottom's Dream</i> (1970). That book is in some sense Schmidt's response to <i>Finnegans Wake</i>; it is a sprawling novel about a brief period, from 4 A.M. to early the next morning, outwardly centered on a discussion of that American father of European modernism, Edgar Allan Poe. Written in three columns and published only as a facsimile of an idiosyncratic typography designed by the author, the "Dream" represents the ultimate but untranslatable challenge to any translator. Mr. Woods has already shown his ability to translate late Schmidt with his version of <i>Evening Edged in Gold</i> (1975). Let us hope that he will have an opportunity to attempt the impossible and give us an English <i>Bottom's Dream</i> too. Then Arno Schmidt will assume his rightful place in modern literature." -Jeremy Alder, <i>New York Times</i><br><br>"A truly witty and innovative writer." -<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>"A giant of postwar German literature." -<i>New York Times</i><br><br>"<i>Zettel&#x2019;s Traum</i> is both Schmidt&#x2019;s most famous book and his least read." -Esther Yi, <i>The New Yorker</i><br><br>"Reading Arno Schmidt can be addictive." -<i>Times Literary Supplement</i></p><h2>On Metaphor (A Critical Inquiry Book)</h2><p><i>On Metaphor</i>, a collection of fourteen essays by eminent philosophers, literary critics, theologians, art historians, and psychologists, illustrates and explores a striking phenomenon in modern intellectual history: the transformation of metaphor from a specialized concern of rhetoricians and literary critics to a central concept in the study of human understanding. These lively and provocative essays probe the nature, function, and meaning of metaphor and collectively demonstrate the multidisciplinary implications of the concept. <br><br>Because of its comprehensive scope, the volume is useful both as a resource for those interested in contemporary philosophy and theories of language and as a text for courses in such areas as the philosophy of language, critical theory, and the philosophy of knowledge. Originally published as a special issue of <i>Critical Inquiry</i>, the present collection includes two new contributions by Max Black and Nelson Goodman, along with a comprehensive index to the work.</p><p>The late <b>Sheldon Sacks</b>, formerly professor of English and linguistics at the University of Chicago, was the author of <i>Fiction and the Shape of Belief</i>, as well as the founding editor of Critical Inquiry.</p><h2>Frank Lloyd Wright and the Prairie</h2><p>Frank Lloyd Wright's residential architecture in and around Oak Park, Illinois, in the early part of this century constitutes some of the architect's most recognizable and distinctive work. From the Oak Park Home and Studio itself, where Wright lived and practiced during this time, to the signature Robie House in Chicago, the extraordinary work from Wright's Prairie period embodies the intense creativity of his early career. Taking his cue from the vast, virgin grasslands that surrounded the Chicago area, Wright produced homes that reflect the land upon which they were built-- with unbroken roof planes, sheltering eaves, and dramatic, sweeping lines. This volume offers a succinct, site-by-site showcase of Wright's first major contribution to American design: the Prairie House.<br><br>Among the homes selected are the Frederick C. Robie House, the Mrs. Thomas Gale House, the William H. Winslow House, and the Dana-Thomas House. Exceptional color photography of Wright's finely wrought interiors-- including his own drafting room at the Home and Studio-- as well as bold exterior perspectives offer readers an inspiring view of Wright's unique architectural mission. With an informative introduction, excerpts from Wright's own writings, and rarely seen archival photographs, <i>Frank Lloyd Wright and the Prairie</i> is a must for all those interested in Wright's work and this definitive period in American architecture.<br><br>"We of the Middle West are living on the prairie. The prairie has a beauty of its own and we should recognize and accentuate this natural beauty, its quiet level."--Frank Lloyd Wright, 1908<br></p><p><b>The Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio Foundation</b> is a not-for-profit organization that operates two Wright-designed landmarks as museums: the architect's own residence and studio in Oak Park, Illinois, and his renowned Prairie Style design, the Frederick C. Robie House on the campus of the University of Chicago. The Foundation also manages collections of Wright furnishings, objects, and artifacts, offers educational programs, and operates a research center on Wright and the Prairie School of architecture. Its mission is to educate a worldwide audience in the architectural and artistic principles of Frank Lloyd Wright, to restore and preserve the Wright-designed structures entrusted to its care, and to present those structures and their collections to the public. The Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio and the Robie House are sites of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.<br><br><b>Melanie Birk </b>is the publications director of the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio Foundation. She has written professionally on the subject of Wright's work for eight years and served as editor of a number of publications, including the book, <i>Frank Lloyd Wright's Fifty Views of Japan</i>.

After a discussion 'On Words and The Word,' he analysess verbal action in St. Augustine's <i>Confessions</i>. He then discusses the first three chapters of Genesis, and ends with a brilliant and profound 'Prologue in Heaven,' an imaginary dialogue between the Lord and Satan in which he proposes that we begin our study of human motives with complex theories of transcendence,' rather than with terminologies developed in the use of simplified laboratory equipment.&nbsp;. . . Burke now feels, after some forty years of search, that he has created a model of the symbolic act which breaks through the rigidities of the 'sacred-secular' dichotomy, and at the same time shows us how we get from secular and sacred realms of action over the bridge of language.&nbsp;. . . Religious systems are <i>systems of action</i> based on communication in society. They are great social dramas which are played out on earth before an ultimate audience, God. But where theology confronts the developed cosmological drama in the 'grand style,' that is, as a fully developed cosmological drama for its religious content, the 'logologer' can be further studied not directly as knowledge but as anecdotes that help reveal for us the quandaries of human governance."&nbsp;--Hugh Dalziel Duncan from <i>Critical Responses to Kenneth Burke, 1924 - 1966</i>, edited by William H.

Now he tells the story of what made solitude on the mountain so attractive: the years he spent reeling in the wake of a family tragedy.</p><p>At the age of twenty-three, Connors was a young man on the make. He'd left behind the Minnesota pig farm on which he'd grown up and the brother with whom he'd never been especially close. He had a magazine job lined up in New York City and a future unfolding exactly as he&#x2019;d hoped. Then one phone call out of the blue changed everything. <em>All the Wrong Places</em> is a searingly honest account of the aftermath of his brother's shocking death, exploring both the pathos and the unlikely humor of a life unmoored by loss.</p><p>Beginning with the otherworldly beauty of a hot-air-balloon ride over the skies of Albuquerque and ending in the wilderness of the American borderlands, this is the story of a man paying tribute to the dead by unconsciously willing himself into all the wrong places, whether at the copy desk of the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, the gritty streets of Bed-Stuy in the 1990s, or the smoking rubble of the World Trade Center. With ruthless clarity and a keen sense of the absurd, Connors slowly unmasks the truth about his brother and himself, to devastating effect. Like Cheryl Strayed's <em>Wild</em>, this is a powerful look back at wayward years&#x2015;and a redemptive story about finding one's rightful home in the world.</p></p><p>"Find room on your bookshelf next to Wallace Stegner and Norman Maclean; Philip Connors is here to stay."<br><b>- Alexandra Fuller</b><br><br>"As this sparklingly well-written memoir bores deeper toward the heart of something that cannot be understood, it keeps getting impossibly better, becoming that much more absorbing, that much more tender, more thoughtful, wry, and heartfelt.

Margie and I have been on a number of safaris over the past 20 years. This time I saw some things I d seen before but never quite as vividly. What I observed is how vicious, competitive, and territorial the jungle is. If you ve ever heard a lion roar, it brings chills up your back. When our long-time guide, Gary Clarke from Topeka, Kansas, imitates the roar, he shouts, &#34;It s mine, mine, mine, mine!&#34; That s because when the lion roars, what he s really saying is, &#34;This is my territory. Don t mess with me.&#34; In fact, lions will kill their sons if they challenge their control over the father s territory. The reason I saw this more vividly than ever before is that I had decided on this trip that I was going to find out as much as I possibly could about Nelson Mandela. We had been at a dinner party where people around the table were asked to share what person-of anyone in the world-they would love to have dinner with. It was a quick decision for me. I said, &#34;Nelson Mandela. I would love to have dinner with a man who was in prison for 28 years and treated cruelly, yet came out of that experience full of love, compassion, and reconciliation.&#34; On the trip, I began to read Mandela s book Long Walk to Freedom. When I compared what I saw in the jungle with how Mandela had reacted to his treatment, I realized that in many ways we as human beings are just intelligent animals. And being intelligent animals, we can choose between being self-serving and serving. The animals in the jungle can t make that choice. A rhino can t get up in the morning and say, &#34;I m going to make friends with the lion today.&#34; It s just not in their temperament. And yet, just as Mandela did, we can make choices to live and lead at a higher level. But when you look at the leaders around the world-whether they re running countries, businesses, churches, educational institutions, or what have you-too many people are choosing to be self-serving rather than serving. Why is that? Because they don t have a different leadership role model. When I contemplated this dilemma, my thinking took me back to my days in graduate school, when I studied Paulo Freire, a revolutionary from Brazil. He wrote a fascinating book called The Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Freire argued that the problem with oppression is that once the oppressed throw off the oppressor, the only leadership role models they have are the very people who oppressed them. Thus, the oppressed become the new oppressors. The ramifications of this are disheartening-not only for countries, but for every enterprise imaginable. This phenomenon creates a new breed of self-serving leaders overseeing a system where all the money, power, and recognition move up the hier-archy and away from the people the organization was established to serve. I think the only answer to this recurring cycle is a different leadership role model. That s what this book is all about-helping individuals and organizations lead at a higher level. Leading at a Higher Level What is leadership? For years we defined leadership as an influence process.We believed that anytime you tried to influence the thoughts and actions of others toward goal accomplishment in either your personal or professional life, you were engaging in leadership. In recent years, we have changed our definition of leadership to the capacity to influence others by unleashing their power and potential to impact the greater good. We made this change for an important reason. When the definition of leadership focuses on goal accomplishment, you can think that leadership is only about results. Yet when we talk about leading at a higher level, just focusing on goal accomplishment is not enough. The key phrase in our new definition is &#34;the greater good&#34;-what is best for all involved. We think leadership is a high calling. Leadership should not be done purely for personal gain or goal accomplishment; it should have a much higher purpose than that. What is a higher purpose? It is not something as internally focused and self-centered as making money. As Matt Hayes and Jeff Stevens contend in The Heart of Business, when it becomes obvious that profit, which is a legitimate goal, is the driving reason for being in business, everyone-stockholders, top managers, employees, customers, suppliers, and the community-quickly becomes self-serving, with a focus on their own agenda and personal enrichment. Employee loyalty and passion often go out the window as the point of work becomes simply to get as much as you can for as little effort as possible.1 What is the answer to this dilemma? A higher purpose-a key element of what we will refer to throughout this book as a compelling vision. In Hayes and Stevens terms, it is outwardly focused, must require sacrifice-in other words, it takes precedence over any short-term goal such as profit-and is intrinsically honorable. Leaders can be successful in the short run if they emphasize only goal accomplishment. What tends to fall by the wayside is the condition of the human organization. Leaders don t always take morale and job satisfaction into consideration-only results count. They forget what the point is. They don t have a higher purpose. In business, with that kind of leadership, it is a short leap to thinking that the only reason to be in business is to make money. There is an either/or added to people and results. Leaders falsely believe that they can t focus on both at the same time. When you are leading at a higher level, you have a both/and philosophy. The development of people-both customers and employees-is of equal importance to performance. As a result, the focus in leading at a higher level is on long-term results and human satisfaction. Leading at a higher level, therefore, is a pro-cess. We define it as the process of achieving worthwhile results while acting with respect, care, and fairness for the well-being of all involved. When that occurs, self-serving leadership is not possible. Why? Self-serving leaders think that leadership is all about them and not about the best interests of those they serve. They forget about acting with respect, care, and fairness for all involved. Everything is about their own self-interest. It s only when you realize that it s not about you that you begin to lead at a higher level. Why Are We Writing This Book? We are writing this book for several reasons. First, our dream is that someday everyone will know someone who is leading at a higher level. Self-serving leaders will be a thing of the past, and leadership throughout the world will be composed of people who, as Robert Greenleaf said, &#34;Serve first and lead second.&#34;2We are writing this book to help make our dream a reality. Second, the vision of The Ken Blanchard Companies is focused on leading at a higher level. This kind of leadership begins with a vision. Jesse Stoner and I wrote a book called Full Steam Ahead!about the power of visioning. To us, a compelling vision tells you who you are your purpose , where you re going your preferred picture of the future , and what will drive your journey your values . The purpose of The Ken Blanchard Companies is to help individuals and organizations lead at a higher level. Our mission statement reflects our new definition of leadership: Unleash the power and potential of people and organizations for the greater good. Our picture of the future is Everyone is trained to lead at a higher level. Every organization is led by people leading at a higher level. People are motivated to lead at a higher level by observing people who lead at a higher level. Our operating valuesare Ethical -Doing the right thing Relationships -Developing mutual trust and respect Success -Operating a profitable and well-run organization Learning -Always growing, inquiring, and developing These values are ordered by rank. In other words, we won t do anything to improve the profitability of the company that is unethical or that doesn t honor the relationships we have with our customers, our people, our suppliers, and our community. We realize that making money is not the higher purpose of our business. You might say that this all sounds like Pollyanna-overly optimistic. That may be, but these are the standards we have set for ourselves. And these are the same high standards we want to help you and the people in your organization reach through this book. Helping individuals and organizations lead at a higher level is our passion, for both your organization and our own. Finally, in many ways this book spells out our leadership point of view. Extensive research shows that effective leaders have a clear leadership point of view and are willing to share with others these beliefs about leading and motivating people. We hope reading this book will impact your leadership point of view. How This Book Is Organized Over the years, I have found that in organizations where leading at a higher level is the rule rather than the exception, people do four things well: They set their sights on the right target and vision. They treat their customers right. They treat their people right. They have the right kind of leadership. This book is organized into four sections. Section I focuses on the right target and visionand integrates our work on the triple bottom line, the characteristics of a high performing organization, and creating a compelling vision. Section II highlights treating the customer rightand integrates our work on legendary service, raving fans, and customer mania. Today, everybody should realize that their customers are the reason their organization exists. Section III focuses on treating your people right. This is where the rubber meets the road. If you don t empower your people and treat them right, they won t take care of your customers, and in the long run, you won t get your desired results. This is the longest section of the book, because your treatment of people is leadership in action. This is what The Ken Blanchard Companies has been focusing on for more than 25 years. In this section, we start with empowerment and then examine four leadership domains: self leadership, one-on-one leadership, team leadership, and organizational leadership. Effective leadership of people starts with looking at yourself-who you are, what you stand for, and how you take initiative when you don t have position power. Without this kind of perspective, it s hard to be effective at one-on-one leadership, where building a partnership based on trust is key. Once you know how to work with individuals, you can begin to build a team and a sense of community. Leading a team is much more complicated than one-on-one leadership and is a precursor to engaging in organizational leadership, which is the most complex leadership domain. Section IV zeros in on the right kind of leadership. Here we re not talking about leadership style; we re talking about character and intentionality. My travels over the years through organizations of all shapes and sizes have convinced me of two things: Effective leadership starts on the inside, and the right kind of leadership is servant leadership. This is a leadership not based on false pride or fear, but one that s grounded in humility and focused on the greater good. With the right kind of leadership, leading at a higher level can become a reality. This section also includes our thoughts on determining your leadership point of view. This turns the focus to you. Here we assist you in pulling together many of the concepts you have learned and help you integrate and apply that knowledge to your own leadership situation. Writing this book has been a labor of love. It pulls together our best thinking from more than 25 years of working together. It truly is Blanchard on Leadership. It includes not only Margie s and my thinking, but also all the wonderful contributions of our founding associates-Don Carew, Eunice Parisi-Carew, Fred Finch, Laurie Hawkins, Drea Zigarmi, and Pat Zigarmi-and other fabulous consulting partners who have really made Blanchard &#34;the home of the authors,&#34; including Alan Randolph, Jesse Stoner, Fay Kandarian, Susan Fowler, Judd Hoekstra, and our son, Scott Blanchard. We think everyone can lead at a higher level, whether at work, at home, or in the community. We hope that, regardless of your position, the size or type of your organization, or the kind of customers or people you serve, you will learn some important information in this book that will help you lead at a higher level and create a high performing organization that not only accomplishes your desired results but is a welcome harbor for the people you touch.

Tolstoy, during two years of obsessive unhappiness, had become convinced that the idea of a &#34;Christian marriage&#34; was an impossibility. Here he lets loose all his frustration and disgust at human sexuality, and the humiliating, ungodly, sensual tie that binds men to women. The curious result, part self-lacerating, confession, part Christian polemic, is moving, above all, as the story of a man whose sexual jealousy, inflamed by guilt, drives him to murder his wife.</p><p>Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910), the Russian prose writer, is chiefly remembered for his novels, War and Peace and Anna Karenina.

Revitalised with a cool new jacket and an anecdote-packed P.S. Section. Welcome to Interzone! Say hello to Bradley the Buyer, the best narcotics agent in the business. Check yourself into the hospital where Dr Benway works -- but don&#39;t expect adrenalin if you need it (the night porter shot it up for kicks). Meet Dr &#39;Fingers&#39; Schafer, the Lobotomy Kid, and his greatest creation, &#39;The Complete American De-anxietized Man&#39;, a marvel of invasive psychiatry who has been reduced to nothing but a spinal cord. Told by an Ivy League-educated narcotics addict, &#39;Naked Lunch&#39; juxtaposes two journeys: the narrator&#39;s physical progress from America to North Africa, via Mexico, and a terrifying descent into his own altered consciousness. In this &#39;Interzone&#39;, loosely based on Burroughs&#39; temporary home of Tangier, sex, drugs and murder are the most basic of commodities, and the basest desires have become completely banal. Provocative, influential, morbidly fascinating and mordantly funny, &#39;Naked Lunch&#39; takes us on an exhilarating ride through the darkest recesses of the human psyche -- a ride which stunned the literary world when first published in the repressed 1950s, and is still guaranteed to epater more than a few bourgeois. Over forty years since first publication, Burroughs scholar Barry Miles and Burroughs&#39; longtime editor James Grauerholz have compiled this definitive restored text, correcting numerous errors that have accumulated over the years, and incorporating all of Burroughs&#39; notes and accompanying essays. Most exciting of all, this edition includes an appendix of newly discovered, never before seen material -- including alternate drafts from the original manuscript and letters from Burroughs&#39; private correspondence.</p><p>"He was," as <i>Salon</i>'s Gary Kamyia notes, "20th-century drug culture's Poe, its Artaud, its Baudelaire. He was the prophet of the literature of pure experience, a phenomenologist of dread.... Burroughs had the scary genius to turn the junk wasteland into a parallel universe, one as thoroughly and obsessively rendered as Blake's." <p> Why has this homosexual ex-junkie, whose claim to fame rests entirely on one book--the hallucinogenic ravings of a heroin addict--so seized the collective imagination? Burroughs wrote <i>Naked Lunch</i> in a Tangier, Morocco, hotel room between 1954 and 1957. Allen Ginsberg and his beatnik cronies burst onto the scene, rescued the manuscript from the food-encrusted floor, and introduced some order to the pages. It was published in Paris in 1959 by the notorious Olympia Press and in the U.S. in 1962; the landmark obscenity trial that ensued served to end literary censorship in America. </p> <p> Burroughs's literary experiment--the much-touted "cut-up" technique--mirrored the workings of a junkie's brain. But it was junk coupled with vision: Burroughs makes teeming amalgam of allegory, sci-fi, and non-linear narration, all wrapped in a blend of humor--slapstick, Swiftian, slang-infested humor. What is <i>Naked Lunch</i> about? People turn into blobs amidst the sort of evil that R. Crumb, in the decades to come, would inimitably flesh out with his dark and creepy cartoon images. Perhaps the most easily grasped part of <i>Naked Lunch</i> is its America-bashing, replete with slang and vitriol. Read it and see for yourself.</p>William Burroughs was born in St Louis, Missouri in 1914. Immensely influential among the Beat writers of the 1950s -- notably Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg -- he already had an underground reputation before the appearance of his first important book, &#39;Naked Lunch&#39;. Originally published by the daring and influential Olympia Press (the original publishers of Henry Miller) in France in 1959, it aroused great controversy on publication and was not available in the US until 1962 and in the UK until 1964. The book was adapted for film by David Cronenberg in 1991.</p><h2>Introduction to Contemporary Civilization in the West: Volume 1</h2><p>Hardback, ex-library, with usual stamps and markings, in fair all round condition suitable as a reading copy.

Its one downside? For nearly a century, it&#x2019;s been illegal to grow industrial cannabis in the United States&#x2013;even though Betsy Ross wove the nation&#x2019;s first flag out of hemp fabric, Thomas Jefferson composed the Declaration of Independence on it, and colonists could pay their taxes with it. But as the prohibition on hemp&#x2019;s psychoactive cousin winds down, one of humanity&#x2019;s longest-utilized plants is about to be reincorporated into the American economy. Get ready for the newest billion-dollar industry.</p> <p>In <em>Hemp Bound:Dispatches from the Front Lines of the Next Agricultural Revolution</em>, bestselling author Doug Fine embarks on a humorous yet rigorous journey to meet the men and women who are testing, researching, and pioneering hemp&#x2019;s applications for the twenty-first century. From Denver, where Fine hitches a ride in a hemp-powered limo; to Asheville, North Carolina, where carbon-negative hempcrete-insulated houses are sparking a mini housing boom; to Manitoba where he raps his knuckles on the hood of a hemp tractor; and finally to the fields of east Colorado, where practical farmers are looking toward hemp to restore their agricultural economy&#x2015;Fine learns how eminently possible it is for this misunderstood plant to help us end dependence on fossil fuels, heal farm soils damaged after a century of growing monocultures, and bring even more taxable revenue into the economy than its smokable relative.</p> <p>Fine&#x2019;s journey will not only leave you wondering why we ever stopped cultivating this miracle crop, it will fire you up to sow a field of it for yourself, for the nation&#x2019;s economy, and for the planet.</p></p><p><p>Doug Fine is a comedic investigative journalist, bestselling author, and solar-powered goat herder.

He talks to a dizzying variety of people who have special knowledge and experience, whacks his hand on a tractor hood made from hemp, and drops in plenty of historical facts for context. (Humanity has an 8,000-year history with this plant.) If you need a crash course in a commodity that could well turn American agriculture on its head over the next few years, look no further.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p></p><br><br><p><strong><em>Booklist</em>-</strong><br> <br> "Little noticed on the sidelines during the recent media controversy over Colorado&#x2019;s decision to legalize marijuana was a groundbreaking movement in Congress to lift a decades-long ban on the popular intoxicant&#x2019;s psychoactively inert cousin, hemp. As elucidated in this witty and informative overview of hemp&#x2019;s enormous agricultural potential,&nbsp;New Mexico-based author and radio reporter&nbsp;Fine argues that not much has ever made sense about the stigma U.S. lawmakers have heaped upon this incredibly versatile plant since it was made illegal back in 1937. Although it bears a strong resemblance to the smokable form of cannabis, hemp is almost completely lacking in THC, the ingredient that bestows marijuana&#x2019;s much sought-after &#x2018;high.' Hemp&#x2019;s incredibly strong internal fibers have been used in making everything from rope and paper to durable clothing and eco-friendly housing. In 11 engaging, myth-busting chapters bearing titles such as 'Grow Your Next Home' and 'Patriots Ponder Planting,' Fine makes clear that hemp legalization, assuming it happens, could both boost the American economy and spawn a mini hemp based industrial revolution.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Hemp Bound</em>&nbsp;is informative, entertaining, and chock full of stories about hemp farmers, wannabe hemp farmers, passionate activists, and savvy business people. It is a fun book to read and hopefully,&nbsp;alongside aggressive legalization at the state level,&nbsp;it&nbsp;will help break down the roadblocks to production that the cotton, vegetable oil, plastics, lumber, and paper corporations constructed and maintained since shortly after the Second World War.&nbsp;Doug Fine is right: this incredible plant could be a boon to large and small farmers and rural communities&#x2015;one that we have been prohibited from growing in this country for more than fifty years.&nbsp;Hemp&#x2019;s time has come again.&#x201d;<strong>--Will Allen, organic farmer; author, <em>The War on Bugs</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;In&nbsp;<em>Hemp Bound,</em>&nbsp;Doug Fine&nbsp;convincingly describes the proven value and amazing potential of the nonpsychoactive variety of the cannabis plant. You can eat it, drink it, read it, tie it, wear it, drive it, live in it, and make money growing it, all while saving the soil and protecting the climate. This is an important story, engagingly told.&#x201d;<strong>--William Martin, senior fellow, drug policy, Rice University&#x2019;s Baker Institute</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;If ever anyone needed proof that government meddling in markets is injurious to innovation,&nbsp;<em>Hemp Bound</em>&nbsp;dispels all doubt. With science and humor, Fine paints an alternative and optimistic future&#x2015;one that makes growing hemp seem&nbsp;as exhilarating and necessary as clean air. Fine&#x2019;s style and storytelling ability make this one of the most fun books you&#x2019;ll ever read about the future of farming.&#x201d;<strong>--Joel Salatin, author of&nbsp;<em>Everything&nbsp;I&nbsp;Want to Do Is Illegal</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Doug Fine&#x2019;s engrossing and eye-opening book reveals hemp&#x2019;s role as a new source of food, energy, and raw materials.

That&#x2019;s what earth medicine does.&#x201d;<strong>--John Trudell, poet, recording artist, actor, activist, and cofounder of Hempstead Project HEART</strong></p><br><br><p><strong>Kirkus Reviews-</strong></p> <p>"What might come back along with legalized pot? Only one of the strongest, most versatile plants in the world: hemp. In his latest, self-described &#x201c;comedic investigative journalist&#x201d; Fine (<em>Too High to Fail: Cannabis and the New Green Economic Revolution</em>, 2012, etc.) focuses on the enormous potential applications for industrialized hemp. As the author ably explains, the plant is the government-designated name for all strains of cannabis that have negligible amounts of THC, meaning it can&#x2019;t get you high. However, it can be used as a wildly strong fiber; when the U.S. government passed the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, suddenly the U.S. Army found itself lacking in decent ropes. It can also create incongruous benefits, like creating nutritious products based on its oil, and can even be used as a potential energy source. To prove his point, Fine chronicles his trips across North America, visiting and profiling entrepreneurs, advocates, farmers and innovators. In Denver, he took a test drive in a hemp oil&#x2013;powered Mercedes-Benz; in Winnipeg, Canada, he visited a factory where enthusiasts are crafting composite materials from hemp that could potentially be used in automobiles, airplanes or industrial tools like tractors. The author also makes the point that the United States is the largest market for Canada&#x2019;s thriving hemp industry, which is regulated smoothly and profitably by its government. Fine is, of course, an accidental activist, too, but it&#x2019;s hard not to admire his enthusiasm. A short, sweet, logical and funny argument for the potential of one of the world&#x2019;s most dynamic cash crops.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;The issue is simple: farmers need hemp, the soil needs hemp, forests need hemp, and humanity needs the plant that the good Lord gave us for our own survival&#x2015;hemp. The benefits are too many to name, but if hemp was a crop that could be monopolized by industrial Ag corporations it would already be legal.&nbsp;<em>Hemp Bound</em>&nbsp;tells us with detail and humor how to get to the environmental Promised Land. Doug has created a blueprint for the America of the future.&#x201d;<strong>--Willie Nelson</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;I never dreamed industrial hemp had so much promise until I read Doug Fine's&nbsp;<em>Hemp Bound</em>. The book is not only fun to read, but it passes along&nbsp;fascinating insights about a farm crop that&nbsp;produces&nbsp;many food and fiber products&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;is adapted to areas where corn and soybeans are rarely profitable. As the author&nbsp;points out with gracious good humor,&nbsp;industrial hemp is not medical marijuana, and it should become a major farm crop in America&nbsp;as&nbsp;it has&nbsp;elsewhere.&#x201d;<strong>--Gene Logsdon, author of&nbsp;<em>Gene Everlasting</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Holy Shit: Managing Manure to Save Mankind</em></strong></p></p><h2>Loose Leaf for Managerial Accounting</h2><p>As the long-time #1 best-seller, Garrison has helped guide close to 3 million students through managerial accounting since it was first published.

He's also been employed by a group of political operatives in New York journalism circles to dig up evidence that Burr is the "natural father," as the expression goes, of up-and-coming presidential candidate Martin van Buren. Schuyler's journal entries are a wondrous prose picture of Jacksonian society, while an imagined autobiographical account from Burr provides a similar depiction of the nation's origins. Like all of Vidal's historical fiction, <i>Burr</i> has little use for America's received iconography, and draws upon contemporary sources to puncture the legendary reputations of Washington and Jefferson. There are also marvelous cameo appearances from figures like Washington Irving and Davy Crockett, of whom Schuyler notes, "He is considered a delightful figure. I can't think why." (There's also a substantial subplot in which Schuyler falls in love with a prostitute named Helen Jewett; readers may be interested to learn that she is, in fact, a real historical figure). <i>--Ron Hogan</i>"Dazzling. . . . Burr is wicked entertainment of a very high order."<br>--The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"A tragedy, a comedy, a vibrant, leg-kicking life. . . . All of this and much, much more is told in a highly engaging book that teems with bon mots, aphorisms and ironic comments on the political process. . . . Enlightening, fresh and fun."&nbsp;&nbsp;--The Boston Globe<br><br>"A novel of Stendhalian proportions. . . . It is probably impossible to be an American and not be fascinated and impressed by Vidal's telescoping of our early history. . . .

It is extraordinarily rich material about a fascinating, distant world. <br> <br>Houston, a young Canadian artist, was on a painting trip to Moose Factory at the south end of Hudson Bay in 1948. A bush pilot friend burst into his room with the news that a medical emergency meant that he could get a free flight into the heart of the eastern Arctic. When they arrived, Houston found himself surrounded by smiling Inuit ? short, strong, utterly confident people who wore sealskins and spoke no English. By the time the medical plane was about to leave, Houston had decided to stay. <br> <br>It was a decision that changed his life. For more than a dozen years he spent his time being educated by those kindly, patient people who became his friends. He slept in their igloos, ate raw fish and seal meat, wore skin clothing, traveled by dog team, hunted walrus, and learned how to build a snowhouse. While doing so, he helped change the North. <br> <br>Impressed by the natural artistic skills of the people, he encouraged the development of outlets in the South for their work, and helped establish co-ops in the North for Inuit carvers and print-makers. Since that time, after trapping as a way of gaining income began to disappear, Inuit art has brought millions of dollars to its creators, and has affected art galleries around the world. <br> <br>In the one hundred short chapters that make up this book, James Houston tells about his fascinating and often hilarious adventures in a very different culture. He tells of raising a family in the Arctic (his sons bursting into tears on being told they were not really Inuit), and of the failure to introduce soccer to a people who refused to look on other humans as opponents. He tells about great characters ? Inuit and <i>kallunait</i> ? who populated the Arctic in these long-lost days when, as a Government go-between, he found himself grappling with Northern customs that broke Southern laws. <br> <br>A remarkable, modestly told story by a truly remarkable man.<b>James Houston</b>, a Canadian author-artist, served with the Toronto Scottish Regiment in World War II, 1940-45, then lived among the Inuit of the Canadian Arctic for twelve years as a Northern Service Officer, and the first Administrator of west Baffin Island, a territory of 65,000 square miles. Widely acknowledged as the prime force in the development of Inuit art, he is past chairman of both the American Indian Arts Centre and the Association on American Indian and Eskimo Cultural Foundation Award, the 1979 Inuit Kuavati Award of Merit, and the 1997 Royal Geographic Society&#x2019;s Massey Medal, and is an officer of the Order of Canada. <br> <br>Among his writings, <i>The White Dawn</i> has been published in thirty-one editions worldwide. That novel and <i>Ghost Fox</i>, <i>Spirit Wrestler</i>, and <i> Eagle Song</i> have been selections of major book clubs. <i>Running West</i> won the Canadian Authors Association Book of the Year Award, while his novel, <i>The Ice Master</i>, also appeared in Spanish translation. Author and illustrator of seventeen children&#x2019;s books, he is the only person to have won the Canadian Library Association Book of the Year Award three times. His most recent children&#x2019;s book is <i>Fire and Ice</i>, about creating glass sculpture. He has also written screenplays for feature films, has created numerous documentaries and continues to lecture widely. <br> <br>His drawings, paintings, and sculptures are internationally represented in many museums including the St. Petersburg Museum in Florida and private collections including that of the King of Saudi Arabia. He is Master Designer for Steuben Glass, with one hundred and ten pieces to his credit. He created the seventy-foot-high central sculpture in the Glenbow-Alberta Art Museum. In 1999 Canada&#x2019;s National Museum of Civilization devoted its show &#x201c;Iqqaipaa&#x201d; to the art of the Arctic in James Houston&#x2019;s time, and he played a central role in organizing the exhibition. <br> <br>He and his wife Alice divided their time between a colonial privateer&#x2019;s house in New England and a writing retreat on the bank of a salmon river on the Queen Charlotte Islands in British Columbia, where he has written a large part of his trilogy of memoirs, <i>Confessions of an Igloo Dweller</i>, <i>Zigzag</i>, and <i>Hideaway</i>. <br> <br>James Houston passed away in 2005 at the age of 83.</p><h2>The Subversive Stitch: Embroidery and the Making of the Feminine</h2><p>In this fascinating study, Rozsika Parker traces a hidden history--the shifting notions of femininity and female social roles--by unraveling the history of embroidery from medieval times until today.</p><p><p>Rozsika Parker's books include <i>Old Mistresses: Women, Art &amp; Ideolo</i>gy and <i>Framing Feminism</i> (both written with Griselda Pollock) and <i>Torn in Two: The Experience of Maternal Ambivalence</i>.&nbsp; Her latest book is <i>The Anxious Gardener.</i>&nbsp; She practices as a psychotherapist in London.</p>"an impressively researched case for evaluating women's lives and their position in society through the history of embroidery."<br>-"Feminist Bookstore News, Jan/Feb 1990 <br>." . .

As intonation lends color to the spoken word, color lends spiritually realized sound to form." - Johannes Itten. Over the years numerous color theories have been published: Goethe's theory of color is as famous as Ostwald's color cirlce. Adolf Holzel exercised an important influence on modern art with his theory of color. Now with his ART OF COLOR Johannes Itten makes a contribution. Using Holzel's theory as a springboard, Itten has expanded and developed it along his own original lines. Although never published before, the Itten theory already underlies progressive art education all over the world. In this book Itten examines two different approaches to understanding the art of color. Subjective feelings and objective color principles are the two poles which are described in detail and clarified with numerous color reproductions. The key to this knowledge lies in the color circle and the seven color contrasts which are found on pages 35-109. The problems of visual, emotional and symbolic color effects are carefully explored with numerous color illustrations. The systematic color exercises are followed by outstanding reproductions of paintings by the great masters - 28 large size, four-color plates - which offer insight into all the epochs of Western painting from the early Middle Ages to Klee and Picasso. With each reproduction is one of Professor Itten's famous analyses which proves how conscious awareness and use of color contrast has been an important means of expression. In the chapter, THEORY OF COLOR EXPRESSION (page 130), the psychic and emotional values expressed by color are examined and explained. This gives an extraordinary approach to the understanding of expressionistic painting. Another important chapter, COMPOSITION (page 144), contains the goal of the whole theory of color for the creative artist. It also represents the crowning point of the book for the viewer of art. According to Itten composition implies brining two or more colors together in such a way that they harmonize to give an expression unambiguous and full of character. When preparing the first printing of THE ART OF COLOR in 1960, author and publisher were faced with the problem of finding the most favorable method of producing the difficult color reproductions. It could only be done by producing the various color plates by entirely different printing processes, which had to be done by several printers, and then tipping them into the book. <p> When a reprinting was planned in 1973, it had by then become possible to make use of the advanced technical developments in offset printing, and the entire book was produced by this printing process. Altogether great care was taken to preserve the excellence of the original edition, Contents and order of pages were retained, some of the illustrations were enlarged and veracity was improved as far as the existing material allowed. Our aim for this new printing was to once again make available in its best form Johannes Itten's color course, while at the same time strictly adhering to his principles of presentation.</p>Johannes Itten (1888-1967) concerned himself with the problems of color all his life. After completing his studies as a teacher, he was able to gain firs knowledge of color theory in Stuttgart, from 1913 to 1916, in the circle of Adolf Holzel. He tested and modified this theory in his own artistic labors, as well as in intensive studies of all available color theories. Johannes Itten treated the problem of color, which present themselves to the painter who works with color as an artist and craftsman the way the scientist explores the physical and chemical properties of color. <p>The significance of Johannes Itten's own artistic achievements as one of the great contributions to the art of the 20th century is undisputed. His color theory, which was condensed in The Art of Color, convincingly synthesized the knowledge of the great painter and the experience of the progressive educator, two poles that stamped Itten's personality. His theory has been thoroughly disseminated all over the world, in many versions and languages. </p><p>The subjective perceptual experience and objective laws of color produce a tension of opposites shown in this book by many examples in color. A comprehensive knowledge of the objective laws is required to grow beyond the subjective laws of color is required to grow beyond the subjective narrowness of conception which is everybody's preliminary approach to the manifestations of color in everyday life and art. Itten fully understood these difficulties. The knowledge of the objective laws of color can be grasped in the color sphere and the seven color contrasts, both of which are derived from the color circle. The problems of impressionistic and expressionistic effects of color are examined in many juxtapositions of examples in color. The foundation of color composition is found through color harmony. After the color exercises, there are reproductions and analysis if the paintings of great masters, old, and new, which testify to the validity of Itten's book and its teachings.</p></p><h2>Greenwich Time and the Discovery of the Longitude</h2><p>Traces the astronomical, navigational, and timekeeping advances that led to the development of Greenwich time, the concept of longitude, and the designation of Greenwich as the prime meridian</p><p></p><h2>One Corpse Too Many (The Chronicles of Brother Cadfael)</h2><p><b>When Shrewsbury Castle falls, Brother Cadfael discovers a murder mystery amid the wreckage </b><br><br>In the summer of 1138, war between King Stephen and the Empress Maud takes Brother Cadfael from the quiet world of his garden into a battlefield of passions, deceptions, and death. Not far from the safety of the abbey walls, Shrewsbury Castle falls, leaving its ninety-four defenders loyal to the empress to hang as traitors. With a heavy heart, Brother Cadfael agrees to bury the dead, only to make a grisly discovery: one extra victim that has been strangled, not hanged.<br>&nbsp;<br>This ingenious way to dispose of a corpse tells Brother Cadfael that the killer is both clever and ruthless. But one death among so many seems unimportant to all but the good Benedictine. He vows to find the truth behind disparate clues: a girl in boy&#x2019;s clothing, a missing treasure, and a single broken flower&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the tiny bit of evidence that Cadfael believes can expose a murderer&#x2019;s black heart.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Ellis Peters is a pseudonym of Edith Mary Pargeter (1913&#x2013;1995), a British author whose Chronicles of Brother Cadfael are credited with popularizing the historical mystery.

Miriam Ticktin focuses on France and its humanitarian immigration practices to argue that a politics based on care and protection can lead the state to view issues of immigration and asylum through a medical lens.

She demonstrates how in an inhospitable immigration climate, unusual pathologies can become the means to residency papers, making conditions like HIV, cancer, and select experiences of sexual violence into distinct advantages for would-be migrants. Ticktin&#x2019;s analysis also indicts the inequalities forged by global capitalism that drive people to migrate, and the state practices that criminalize the majority of undocumented migrants at the expense of care for the exceptional few.</p><p>"<i>Casualties of Care</i> is a well crafted, intelligent and carefully argued study of the social and policy effects of a seemingly benevolent set of 'humanitarian practices' used in the French immigration and asylum processes.

The contents of the book are IDENTICAL to the previous version. The only two differences are: The new one is perfect bound (Glued back pages for extra strength) not comb-bound and does not come with a CD Rom Version.* * NEW Alpha-Phonics is at a SPECIAL LOW Price of only $ 24.95. (The same price Alpha-Phonics sold for in 1989! 27 years ago!) The fabled Alpha-Phonics systematic phonics instruction program used by 100s of thousands since it was introduced in the late 1970&#39;s. Alpha-Phonics is probably the simplest, most effective and reasonably priced phonics instruction programs available anywhere. HERE IS WHY IT WORKS SO WELL: IT IS SIMPLE!! There are only 44 phonograms (Sounds) the child needs to learn. Reading, contrary to what you have been told, is easy to teach because all you have to do is teach the student to SOUND OUT the words they need to read. At first they sound the words out aloud, later they do it in their head silently. That is ALL there is to teaching reading. MOM get this: All 128 Lessons in Alpha-Phonics are covered in ONLY 14 pages of instructions for you. Students begin with short vowels putting together simple words (Like a with m = am or a with s = as) and progress to the more advanced words. With Alpha-Phonics the beginner can be reading simple sentences by lesson three, and that can even be on the first day! Other reading instruction programs try to do too much. They inject grammar, pictures and other material, needlessly complicating the task. Alpha-Phonics just teaches reading only. Alpha-Phonics has as a BONUS: you teach SPELLING easily as you go (through simple dictation). Alpha-Phonics easily introduces over 3,500 words in its simple 128 lessons. Some can learn to read in only months. Alpha-Phonics also works very well for older students, even grown adults who need remediation. Is there a negative about Alpha-Phonics? Yes. In the past 30 years we have heard only one criticism (Only a few times). It is: Some Moms say they think their child can become bored when taught by Alpha-Phonics. Why? Parents have been convinced that learning has to be a fun time. They believe games, card decks, cartoons/pictures, spin the needle tricks, etc. make it fun. They feel they have to entertain their kids while teaching. But, this unnecessarily slows down the process. With Alpha-Phonics the student can actually be READING simple sentences even day ONE! Students do see lists of words in Alpha-Phonics lessons, but they QUICKLY are actually READING those words; they are accomplishing, instead of being entertained. Bells and Whistles in other programs slow the process and cost time and money $$. The huge sense of success in actually reading soon overcomes any other consideration. We almost forgot the SUPER BONUS: Many ADULTS become BETTER readers while teaching their child! Alpha-Phonics: highly recommended by Homeschool reviewers Cathy Duffy, Mary Pride, Karen Andreola, The Robinsons. * * You can buy the CD Rom version separately on Amazon.com for only $ 9.00 (It used to be $ 39.95) Find the CD ROM version on at ISBN: 9780941995184.

In addition to writing more than two dozen works of fiction, including <i>Kim</i> and <i>The Jungle Book</i>, Kipling was a prolific poet, composing verse in every classical form from the epigram to the ode. Kipling&#x2019;s most distinctive gift was for ballads and narrative poems in which he&nbsp;drew vivid characters in universal situations, articulating profound truths in plain language. Yet he was also a subtle, affecting anatomist of the human heart, and his deep feeling for the natural world was exquisitely expressed in his verse. He was shattered by World War I, in which he lost his only son, and his work darkened in later years but never lost its extraordinary vitality. All of these aspects of Kipling&#x2019;s poetry are represented in this selection, which ranges from such well-known compositions as &#x201c;Mandalay&#x201d; and &#x201c;If&#x201d; to the less-familiar, emotionally powerful, and personal epigrams he wrote in response to the war.</p><p><b>Rudyard Kipling </b>was born in Bombay, India to British parents on December 30, 1865. In 1871, Rudyard and his sister, Trix, aged three, were left to be cared for by a couple in Southsea, England. Five years passed before he saw his parents again. His sense of desertion and despair were later expressed in his story &#x201c;Baa Baa, Black Sheep&#x201d; (1888), in his novel <i>The Light that failed </i>(1890), and his autobiography, <i>Something of Myself </i>(1937). As late as 1935 Kipling still spoke bitterly of the &#x201c;House of Desolation&#x201d; at Southsea: &#x201c;I should like to burn it down and plough the place with salt.&#x201d;At twelve he entered a minor public school, the United Services College at Westward Ho, North Devon. In <i>Stalky</i> <i>and CO. </i>(1899) the myopic Beetle is a self-caricature, and the days at Westward Ho are recalled with mixed feelings. At sixteen, eccentric and literary, Kipling sailed to India to become a journalist. His Indian experiences led to seven volumes of stories, including <i>Soldiers Three </i>(1888) and <i>Wee Willie Winkie </i>(1888).At twenty-four he returned to England and quickly tuned into a literary celebrity. In London he became close friends with an American, (Charles) Wolcott Balestier, with whom he collaborated on what critics called a &#x201c;dime store novel.&#x201d; Wolcott died suddenly in 1891, and a few weeks later Kipling married Wolcott&#x2019;s sister, Caroline. The newlyweds settled in Brattleboro, Vermont, where Kipling wrote<b> The Jungle Book</b><i> </i>(1895), and most of <b>Captains Courageous</b><i> </i>(1897). By this time Kipling&#x2019;s popularity and financial success were enormous.In 1899 the Kipling&#x2019;s settled in Sussex, England, where he wrote some of his best books: <b>Kim</b><i> </i>(1901), <i>Just So Stories </i>(1902), and <i>Puck of Pooks Hill </i>(1906). In 1907 he received the Nobel Prize for literature. By the time he died, on January 18 1936, critical opinion was deeply divided about his writings, but his books continued to be read by thousands, and such unforgettable poems and stories as &#x201c;Gunga Din,&#x201d; &#x201c;If,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Man Who Would Be King,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Rikki-Tikki-Tavi&#x201d; have lived on in the consciousness of succeeding generations.<b>Peter Washington</b> is the editor of several Everyman's Library Pocket Poet anthologies, including <i>Love Poems</i>, <i>Friendship Poems</i>, and <i>Poems of Mourning</i>.</p><h2>Reading &amp; Writing Chinese: Traditional Character Edition, A Comprehensive Guide to the Chinese Writing System</h2><p><i>Reading and Writing Chinese</i> has been the standard text for foreign students and teachers of the Chinese Writing System since Tuttle first published it over 20 years ago.

Cahn&#39;s advice on the professorial life covers an extensive range of critical issues: how to plan, complete, and defend a dissertation; how to navigate a job interview; how to improve teaching performance; how to prepare and publish research; how to develop a professional network; and how to garner support for tenure. He deals with such hurdles as a difficult dissertation advisor, problematic colleagues, and the pressures of the tenure clock. Whether you are beginning graduate study, hoping to secure an academic position, or striving to build a professorial career, Cahn&#39;s insights are invaluable to traversing the thickets of academia.</p><p><p>An insider's guide to building an academic career.</p>Steven M. Cahn is professor of philosophy at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, where he served as provost and vice president for academic affairs and then acting president.

Mandelbaum's translation, with facing original text and with illustrations by Barry Moser, has been praised by Robert Fagles as "exactly what we have waited for these years, a Dante with clarity, eloquence, terror, and profoundly moving depths," and by the late James Merrill as "lucid and strong . . . with rich orchestration . . . overall sweep and felicity . . . and countless free, brilliant, utterly Dantesque strokes." Charles Simic called the work "a miracle. A lesson in the art of translation and a model (an encyclopedia) for poets. The full range and richness of American English is displayed as perhaps never before."<br><br>This collection of commentaries on the first part of the <i>Comedy</i> consists of commissioned essays, one for each canto, by a distinguished group of international scholar-critics. Readers of Dante will find this <i>Inferno</i> volume an enlightening and indispensable guide, the kind of lucid commentary that is truly adapted to the general reader as well as the student and scholar.</p><p><b>Anthony Oldcorn</b>, Professor and Chair of Italian Studies at Brown University, and <b>Charles Ross</b>, Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Purdue University, have joined with National Book Award winner <b>Allen Mandelbaum</b>, who is W.R.

As we prepare to enter a new millennium people continue to turn to Emily Post for advice on etiquette and manners. While etiquette remains a code ofbehavior based on kindness, consideration and unselfishness that does not change, our manners, the practice of etiquette, <i>must</i> change as our world changes. The world of today is both vasdy different and astonishingly the same as the world Emily Post herself knew. Seventy-five years after Emily Post wrote her groundbreaking book, Peggy Post, her great-grand-daughter-in-law, has thoroughly revised and updated <i>Emily Post's Etiquette</i> to take us into the next century.<p>The hallmarks that define <i>Emily Post's Etiquette </i>as an indispensable resource remain: the correct table-setting for an intimate dinner party of eight, the proper response to a formal third-person invitation, and of course, all the details of planning a wedding. But in a world where our neighbors and coworkers are as likely to come from the other side of the globe as the other side of town, changes both subde and radical are necessary in our manners. In addition to a chapter devoted to doing business internationally, readers find not only advice for visiting those from other cultures living in our country, but also guidance on wearing ethnic clothing when traveling in other countries. Previous editions have explained the traditions of Christianity and Judaism but now for the first time readers learn about birth and death ceremonies of Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism. Sports participants who used to read only about the etiquette of golf, tennis, skiing and sailing, now learn about in-line skating and snowboarding as well.</p><p><i>Emily Post's Etiquette,</i> is not just for your grandmothers generation. It's for all of us.</p></p><p>In 1922, Emily Post came out with the definitive book on etiquette. To celebrate its 75th anniversary, her great-granddaughter-in-law Peggy Post has updated and revised the opus into an 845-page 16th edition that takes modern conundrums and lifestyles into account. If you&#39;re wondering when to put a napkin in your lap and which foods may be eaten with fingers, the information&#39;s still there. But situations Emily never dreamed of--matters of e-mail, cellular phones, step parents, fourth weddings, and in-line skating--are considered with the same grace that made Emily the last word on civility in the 1920s.The indispensable guide to manners, now including the changes our society and etiquette have undergone in recent years. Completely revised and updated for the 21st century.</p><h2>Pocahontas, Powhatan, Opechancanough: Three Indian Lives Changed By Jamestown</h2><p><p>Pocahontas may be the most famous Native American who ever lived, but during the settlement of Jamestown, and for two centuries afterward, the great chiefs Powhatan and Opechancanough were the subjects of considerably more interest and historical documentation than the young woman. It was Opechancanough who captured the foreign captain "Chawnzmit"&#x2015;John Smith. Smith gave Opechancanough a compass, described to him a spherical earth that revolved around the sun, and wondered if his captor was a cannibal. Opechancanough, who was no cannibal and knew the world was flat, presented Smith to his elder brother, the paramount chief Powhatan. The chief, who took the name of his tribe as his throne name (his personal name was Wahunsenacawh), negotiated with Smith over a lavish feast and opened the town to him, leading Smith to meet, among others, Powhatan&#x2019;s daughter Pocahontas. Thinking he had made an ally, the chief finally released Smith. Within a few decades, and against their will, his people would be subjects of the British Crown.</p><p></p><p>Despite their roles as senior politicians in these watershed events, no biography of either Powhatan or Opechancanough exists. And while there are other "biographies" of Pocahontas, they have for the most part elaborated on her legend more than they have addressed the known facts of her remarkable life. As the 400th anniversary of Jamestown&#x2019;s founding approaches, nationally renowned scholar of Native Americans, Helen Rountree, provides in a single book the definitive biographies of these three important figures. In their lives we see the whole arc of Indian experience with the English settlers &#x2013; from the wary initial encounters presided over by Powhatan, to the uneasy diplomacy characterized by the marriage of Pocahontas and John Rolfe, to the warfare and eventual loss of native sovereignty that came during Opechancanough&#x2019;s reign.</p><p>Writing from an ethnohistorical perspective that looks as much to anthropology as the written records, Rountree draws a rich portrait of Powhatan life in which the land and the seasons governed life and the English were seen not as heroes but as Tassantassas (strangers), as invaders, even as squatters. The Powhatans were a nonliterate people, so we have had to rely until now on the white settlers for our conceptions of the Jamestown experiment. This important book at last reconstructs the other side of the story.</p></p><p><p>Helen C. Rountree, Professor Emerita of Anthropology at Old Dominion University, is the author and editor of numerous works on the Native Americans of the East Coast, including <i>Powhatan Foreign Relations, 1500-1722</i> and, with Thomas E. Davidson, <i>Eastern Shore Indians of Virginia and Maryland</i> (both Virginia).</p><p>"This is an extremely valuable book that will appeal to a wide audience of general readers and scholars.... It is written in a lively style and really makes good on the promise to tell the story of early seventeenth-century Virginia from the Native Americans&#x2019; point of view.</p> (Karen O.

In ABOUT TREES, Katie Holten invites us to enter some of these forests. She has created a Tree Alphabet and used it to translate a compendium of well known, loved, lost and new writing. She takes readers on a journey from 'primeval atoms' and cave paintings to the death of a 3,500 year-old cypress tree, from Tree Clocks in Mongolia and forest fragments in the Amazon to Emerson's language of fossil poetry, unearthing a grove of beautiful stories along the way.<br><br>ABOUT TREES is the first book in Broken Dimanche Press's series: <em>Parapoetics--a Literature beyond the Human.</em> Recognizing a crisis of representation as our species adapts to life in the Anthropocene, ABOUT TREES considers our relationship with language, landscape, and perception. The result is an astonishing fusion of storytelling and art, which celebrates trees and our understanding of them, their past and their future, their potential and their ubiquity. It is a book to leaf through, again and again.<br><br>Texts by Andrea Bowers, Inger Christensen, Tacita Dean, Amy Franceschini, Charles Gaines, James Gleick, Fritz Haeg, Amy Harmon, Natalie Jeremijenko, Eduardo Kohn, Elizabeth Kolbert, Irene Kopelman, Ursula K.

Unlike traditional empirical psychology, it is more oriented toward the "how" than the "what." An experiment in mind design is more likely to be an attempt to build something and make it work&#x2015;as in artificial intelligence&#x2015;than to observe or analyze what already exists. Mind design is psychology by reverse engineering.</p><p>When <i>Mind Design</i> was first published in 1981, it became a classic in the then-nascent fields of cognitive science and AI. This second edition retains four landmark essays from the first, adding to them one earlier milestone (Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence") and eleven more recent articles about connectionism, dynamical systems, and symbolic versus nonsymbolic models. The contributors are divided about evenly between philosophers and scientists. Yet all are "philosophical" in that they address fundamental issues and concepts; and all are "scientific" in that they are technically sophisticated and concerned with concrete empirical research.</p><p><b>Contributors<br></b>Rodney A.

A world away from the brutal sieges of Sarajevo and the nationalist rhetoric of Milo&#x161;evi&#x107;, she instead has to cope with everyday life in America, where she's assaulted by "strong personalities," the cult of the body, endless amounts of jogging and exercise, bagels, and an obsession with public confession. Organized as a fictional dictionary, these early essays of Ugresic's (revised and amended for this edition) allow us to see American culture through the eyes of a woman whose country is being destroyed by war, and forces us to see through the comforting veil of Western consumerism.</p><p><b>Dubravka Ugresic</b> is the author of six works of fiction, including <i>The Museum of Unconditional Surrender</i>, and six essay collections, including the NBCC award finalist, <i>Karaoke Culture.</i> She went into exile from Croatia after being labeled a "witch" for her anti-nationalistic stance during the Yugoslav war.

How are you?&#x201d; &#x201c;And how are you?&#x201d; . . . We chat, we condense three years of our lives into brief reports: she&#x2019;s finished her doctorate and found a job and had a daughter.<br>&#x201c;Oh, you must come and see her! She is such a strong personality.&#x201d;<br>This footnote&#x2014;strong personality&#x2014;pricks my ear like an acupuncture needle and won&#x2019;t go away.<br><br>I imagine a spoiled brat, which is what &#x201c;strong personality&#x201d; means in this case. The brat part doesn&#x2019;t bother me, it&#x2019;s the intonation. Because she, my acquaintance, doesn&#x2019;t know I&#x2019;ve heard this phrase, spoken with that same intonation, countless times since I&#x2019;ve been here, and that suggests to me that there is a predominance here of people with strong personalities, so, therefore, my life here was going to be remarkably exciting.<br><br>There&#x2019;s an entire industry for the production of personality. Child psychologists, adult psychiatrists, laws, established codes of behavior, newspapers, publishing houses, television. Everything is for sale, from textbooks with ego-building exercises to audio-cassettes advising us how to turn a grating voice into one that is deep and agreeable.<br><br>But still, in order for a person to have a personality, he must, it would seem, earn it, he has to have a destiny which will be authentic and his alone. But the praxis of everyday life rudely quashes one&#x2019;s right to a personal destiny simply because it instantly transforms it into a public, collective one.<br><br>In totalitarian systems the individual preserved his privacy like the family valuables. What he did not himself succeeded in preserving in the &#x201c;house safe,&#x201d; was preserved in police safes&#x2014;by the police. The police were as discreet as one&#x2019;s most loyal friend. The genre of the personal confession is unknown to the literatures of totalitarian systems (the less you talk about yourself, the thinner your police file will be!). Indeed, literature begins where the personal confession ends. Literature under totalitarian regimes has exploited the rich strategies of literary devices, lies&#x2014;the essence of literature, in other words&#x2014;in order to express its truth indirectly about the world. With the fall of communism the genre of the personal confession sprang into being: suddenly it transpired that our lives were as like as two peas in a pod. The freedom of confession has destroyed the aura of uniqueness the author used to have, the aura of tragic personal fate.<br><br>It seems that America does not produce anything other than the genre of collective autobiography. The average American appears to be lurching unconsciously towards a large media interviewing room where they will confess their lives. The role of the discreet police in totalitarian systems has been taken over in the American democratic system by the indiscreet media. Bookstores are full of personal stories that describe the author (he or she) being raped, surviving incurable disease, curing depression, dragging themselves out of the jaws of drug addiction, doing this and doing that.<br><br>American television programs, too, have become public collective confessionals: they compete as to who will confess more, better, more keenly. TV-confessionals are like gladiators&#x2019; arenas in which the fighters wrestle with emotions, and the audience enjoys the fresh, authentic bloodletting. Confessions are sometimes produced like real Greek plays: relations, sisters, brothers and children are brought on to play out an authentic family melodrama before the eyes of the viewers. Americans today make public confessions of their personal experience&#x2014;to order.<br><br>And what has happened to the sacred American right to privacy?<br><br>If you stare at an American&#x2019;s house for longer than three minutes, the owner has the right, according to one of the many laws that sanction the sacred right to privacy, to call the police. On the other hand this same American will not hold back from telling you his whole life&#x2019;s story at the first available opportunity. If he holds back, the media will do it for him. Because the private is public. It is not advisable in America today to shut the door of the office where you work. During office hours professors keep their doors wide open so as not to be accused of harassment. And the right to personal illness has also been withdrawn. This is why Magic Johnson briefly informed the media as he emerged from the delivery room: &#x201c;He&#x2019;s negative!&#x201d; The whole of America knew what this &#x201c;negative&#x201d; referred to. Johnson&#x2019;s newborn baby did not have HIV! Even the right to personal suicide has been withdrawn, as the very next day the media will make your tragic, fresh, personal corpse into a collective sociological theme.<br><br>America today is writing its great collective autobiography. And when everyone writes what ensues is a universal deafness and lack of understanding, as Kundera once wrote. The American market of ideas is not giving up, the commercial effect of the personal obliges it to establish new aesthetic criteria: only what is <i>truthful, authentic, personal</i> is of aesthetic value. <br><br>Will Americans soon begin to wonder how it is that they&#x2014;who have believed their whole lives in ideologemes about individualism, individual choice, personalness&#x2014;are so remarkably like their next-door neighbors? The American media market, which anticipates all problems by immediately giving them voice, offers its new great, global, safeguarding idea of self-esteem. Work on self-esteem (national, professional, age-specific, physical, private, sexual) anticipates the awareness of defeat, the awareness that something isn&#x2019;t quite right after all&#x2014;because this implies in advance that something is wrong. Work on self-esteem is a form of ego-training as a safeguard, a new fashion product on the American market of ideas.<br><br>And if I change the lens for a moment and ask myself who I am, the observer, I&#x2019;m acutely aware that my self-esteem suddenly melts away. Have the sick the right to judge the healthy? Am I not a sort of invalid observing the reality around me from a wheelchair with the eyes of a limited and therefore superficial observer?</p><h2>Free Range Learning: How Homeschooling Changes Everything</h2><p>"Free Range Learning should be read by every parent, teacher, and school administrator as the beginning of education reform that includes respect for the learning process of every child.

No one ever proved they weren&#39;t real. She found peace in a small forest behind her home, where she hoped small woodland creatures might grow to trust her and eat the offerings of food she brought each day. They didn&#39;t. She also sought refuge in books, happily bringing home dozens each week from that heavenly realm called The Library. When told, &#34;get your nose out of that book and go outside&#34; she rode her trusty pink bike for hours. Quite regularly she discovered the thrill of getting lost. Back then small girls found their own way home from construction sites, major highways and Lake Erie. The only consequence? A sense of adventure. The continuing adventure has led Laura to write a book of poetry with nursing home residents, run support groups for abused children, teach nonviolence workshops, develop community enrichment programs and make messy art. Laura lives on Bit of Earth Farm with her family. Although she&#39;s not a particularly useful farm wench she takes part in raising cows, chickens, produce, honeybees, and the occasional ruckus. In her idle hours she writes essays and articles, edits other people&#39;s books, spends time on the blog she said she&#39;d never start, writes poetry, and is slow at work on her next book. Catch up with her at lauragraceweldon.com By the way, she&#39;s learned that the alligators haunting us are exactly where any of us put them.A child&#39;s wonder is a precious thing. Kept alive, it remains a lifelong wellspring of curiosity, awe and heightened awareness. The challenge is to live in such a way that wonder is not smothered. Each baby is born with a unique set of capabilities. Ideally the child grows toward his or her potential as children have throughout time---through observation, exploration and hands-on learning. Learning happens constantly. Naturally. The inborn drive to gain meaningful first hand experience is often at odds with the predetermined course set before today&#39;s students. Many styles of homeschooling foster greater comprehension than the typical school environment. That&#39;s because experiential learning, along with the guidance of parents and other elders, is precisely the education known throughout the majority of human history. This is how we as a species learn best. Schooling is the experiment. As homeschooling parents we can take into account individual learning styles, innate skills and interests to bring out the best in each child without being restricted by the dictates of any institution. We can educate as easily as we breathe simply by remaining fully present to our children&#39;s questions and enthusiasms. The homeschooling child&#39;s life is filled with conversation, music, play, stories, struggles and overcoming struggles, chores, laughter and the excitement of examining in depth any of the rich wells of knowledge that humanity has to offer. Each of us needs to feel we belong, that our relationships are of value and our efforts have purpose. We can&#39;t expect any one institution to meet these needs. Homeschoolers take responsibility for learning back to the family realm but do so in the context of the larger community where each child grows whole and strong within a vibrant network. As we nurture children who learn eagerly we help them to mature into adults fully suited to meet the challenges of the future. Homeschooling families have time for quiet days at home as well as time for community involvement. We know that new endeavors spark enthusiasm and develop confidence. As we seek out wider ways of learning, we collaborate with people and organizations in ways that benefit all of us. Nowadays homeschooled youth are gaining recognition as innovative, self-directed thinkers with diverse experiences. By the time homeschooled young people apply to college or set out for the working world they are blessed with an ongoing zest for learning.</p><h2>Loose-Leaf for Auditing &amp; Assurance Services: A Systematic Approach</h2><p>The fundamental values central to the Messier Jr./Glover/Prawitt text include: student engagement, a systematic approach, and decision making.<p>Student Engagement: The authors believe students are best served by acquiring a strong understanding of the basic concepts that underlie the audit process and how to apply those concepts to various audit and assurance services. The text is accessible to students through straightforward writing and the use of engaging, relevant real-world examples, illustrations, and analogies. The text explicitly encourages students to &#x201c;stop and think&#x201d; at important points in the text to help them apply principles covered and also helps students see the application of concepts in a practical setting through &#x201c;practice insight&#x201d; boxes.</p><p>A Systematic Approach: The authors first introduce the three underlying concepts of audit risk, materiality, and evidence, then follow with a discussion of audit planning, the assessment of control risk, and a discussion of the nature, timing, and extent of evidence necessary to reach the appropriate level of detection risk. These concepts are then applied to each major business process and related account balances using a risk-based approach, (in following with the new standards adopted by the various auditing boards).</p><p>Decision Making: Since much of auditing practice involves the application of auditor judgment, the authors focus on critical judgments and decision-making processes. If a student understands these basic concepts and how to apply them to an audit engagement, he or she will be more effective in today's dynamic audit environment. The new edition even includes a full advanced module on Professional Judgment.</p></p><p>Professor William F.

(Lernmaterialien)</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p></p><h2>Transformative Relationships: The Control Mastery Theory of Psychotherapy</h2><p>The control-mastery theory, developed by Dr. Joseph Weiss over the second half of the twentieth century, is an attempt to integrate an understanding of how the mind works, how psychopathologies develop, and how psychotherapy can effectively help. Control-Mastery theory assumes that the patient's problems are rooted in the grim, constricting pathogenic beliefs that the patient acquires in the traumatic experiences of childhood. The driving force behind the psychotherapeutic process is the patient's conscious and unconscious desire to recover the capacity to pursue life goals by gaining control and mastering self destructive patterns of thoughts and behaviors. Underlying this theory is the conception that the client structures (both consciously and unconsciously) the psychotherapeutic process in order to clearly and quickly address her own goals. Following this line of thought, the practitioner must be able to identify a client's aims, respond to and encourage these thoughts, and develop a strategic therapeutic plan to effectively address the needs and wants of each individual. This book aims to present the control-mastery theory in a more accessible format, and introduce it to a wider audience, expanding the scope of the theory beyond simply a comparison to Freudian analysis. The text presents an integrated cognitive-psychodynamic-relational approach to therapy, addressing issues surrounding psychopathology and pathogenic constructions. Organized into three distinct sections, the book first considers theoretical underpinnings before moving into in-depth discussions of clinical and practical application of these valuable therapeutic tools and techniques, drawing heavily on detailed descriptions of entire therapy sessions. The final section of the book covers current and developing empirical research, presenting convincing arguments in support of the theory and practice earlier discussed. The editor has extensive research and clinical experience with both the conceptual and practical aspects of the theory, and has worked with Joseph Weiss and Hal Sampson - the two pioneers of the control-mastery approach - who each contributes a chapter to the book. <em>Transformative Relationships</em> advances this integrative approach to therapy beyond its current scope, introducing these valuable concepts and techniques to a wider audience of practitioners of all backgrounds.</p><p>George Silberschatz, Ph.D., is a&nbsp;Clinical Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of California - San Francisco and Co-Director of the Mount Zion Brief Psychotherapy Research Project, at the Mount Zion Medical Center of UC San Francisco.

You learn about the basics of primal cooking and living, source the best ingredients and kitchen items, and then be off and running with creative recipes in the following categories:&nbsp;Meat, Offal, Fowl, Seafood, Vegetables, Eggs, Primal Substitutes, Marinades, Sauces and Dressings, Desserts, Beverages, Primal Kitchen mayo and dressings, and Keto Recipes.</p><p><b></b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even if you&#x2019;re an enthusiastic meat eater, you&#x2019;ll break through to the next level with the creative preparations of Offal (animal organ meats.)

Years of painstaking research and analysis of previously untapped Japanese-language resources have produced this remarkable history of the navy&#39;s dizzying development, tactical triumphs, and humiliating defeat. Unrivaled in its breadth of coverage and attention to detail, this important new study explores the foreign and indigenous influences on the navy&#39;s thinking about naval warfare and how to plan for it. Focusing primarily on the much-neglected period between the world wars, David C. Evans and Mark R. Peattie, two widely esteemed historians, persuasively explain how the Japanese failed to prepare properly for the war in the Pacific despite an arguable advantage in capability.</p><p>Now in paperback for the first time, this classic history of WWII was a recipient of the Society for Military History&#39;s 1999 Distinguished Book Award.

Through a giant and elaborate chess game, Alice explores this odd country, where one must eat dry biscuits to quench thirst, and run like the wind to stay in one place. As in life, Alice must stay on her toes to learn the rules of this game. <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> immediately took its rightful place beside its partner on the shelf of eternal classics. And luckily for generations of enraptured children, Carroll was again able to persuade John Tenniel to create the fantastic woodblock engravings that have become so indelibly associated with the Alice stories. For almost 130 years, Alice's curious adventures have amused, perplexed, and delighted readers, young and old. This gorgeous, deluxe boxed set of both volumes contains engravings from Tenniel's original woodblocks that were discovered in a London bank in 1985, and reproduced for the first time here.

Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.</p><h2>City of Dreams: Dodger Stadium and the Birth of Modern Los Angeles</h2><p><p><b>On the sixtieth anniversary of the Dodgers' move to Los Angeles, the full story of the controversial building of Dodger Stadium and how it helped transform the city</b></p><p>When Walter O'Malley moved his Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles in 1957 with plans to construct a new ballpark next to downtown, he ignited a bitter argument over the future of a rapidly changing city. For the first time, <i>City of Dreams</i> tells the full story of the controversial building of Dodger Stadium&#x2015;and how it helped create modern Los Angeles by transforming its downtown into a vibrant cultural and entertainment center.</p><p>In a vivid narrative, Jerald Podair tells how Los Angeles was convulsed between 1957 and 1962 over whether, where, and how to build Dodger Stadium. Competing civic visions clashed. Would Los Angeles be a decentralized, low-tax city of neighborhoods, as demanded by middle-class whites on its peripheries? Or would the baseball park be the first contribution to a revitalized downtown that would brand Los Angeles as a national and global city, as advocated by leaders in business, media, and entertainment?</p><p>O'Malley's vision triumphed when he opened his privately constructed stadium on April 10, 1962&#x2015;and over the past half century it has contributed substantially to the city's civic and financial well-being. But in order to build the stadium, O'Malley negotiated with the city to acquire publicly owned land (from which the city had uprooted a Mexican American community), raising sharply contested questions about the relationship between private profit and "public purpose." Indeed, the battle over Dodger Stadium crystallized issues with profound implications for all American cities, and for arguments over the meaning of equality itself.</p><p>Filled with colorful stories, <i>City of Dreams</i> will fascinate anyone who is interested in the history of the Dodgers, baseball, Los Angeles, and the modern American city.</p></p><p><p>"When the Dodgers left Brooklyn, their troubles had just begun. Jerald Podair's account of the Los Angeles end of the story superbly chronicles the fierce collisions that ensued, pitting private power against the public good. The creation of Dodger Stadium also created modern Los Angeles, which makes this book an indispensable contribution to the history of modern urban America."<b>--Sean Wilentz, Princeton University</b></p><p>"What is the price of a game? What is it worth to a city and its residents to boast a professional sports franchise? These questions need to be answered--but seldom are&#x2014;before urban leaders make deals to build stadiums, often with staggering implications for their cities. <i>City of Dreams</i> is required reading for anyone who cares about how our sports obsession affects the urban landscape."<b>&#x2014;Randy Roberts, coauthor of <i>Blood Brothers: The Fatal Friendship Between Muhammad Ali and Malcolm X</i></b></p><p>"<i>City of Dreams</i> documents the steep social price Los Angeles paid when, fifty years ago, its power elite used the highly subsidized Dodger Stadium to launch the city into modernity. To what ends and to whose benefit? Podair asks. Hard questions, indeed, that other American cities with subsidized stadiums are asking too."<b>--Kevin Starr, University of Southern California</b></p><p>"A brilliant reconstruction of the battle over Dodger Stadium, <i>City of Dreams</i> is a vivid and indispensable story about baseball and the making of modern urban America."<b>--Gary Gerstle, author of <i>Liberty and Coercion: The Paradox of American Government from the Founding to the Present</i></b></p><p>"There's a real need for this book. There is no other go-to source on the story of Dodger Stadium in the history of Los Angeles, a subject that offers a fascinating look at midcentury L.A. Jerald Podair helps us understand a complex story of urban vision, sports, politics, and public-private tug of war, offering a corrective to much folklore, hyperbole, and misinformation."<b>--William Deverell, coauthor of <i>Water and Los Angeles: A Tale of Three Rivers, 1900&#x2013;1941</i></b></p><b>Jerald Podair</b> is professor of history and the Robert S.

This reissue includes a new introduction by the author.</p><p><b>Howard Gardner</b> is the John H. and Elisabeth A. Hobbs Professor in Cognition and Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Among numerous honors, Gardner received a MacArthur Prize Fellowship in 1981. In 1990, he was the first American to receive the University of Louisville's Grawemeyer Award in education. In 2000, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.A convincing call to reexamine the way children learn in their earliest years, and to make use of those new findings in classrooms. MacArthur fellow Gardner (Education/Harvard; To Open Minds, 1989, etc.) developed a theory that human beings learn and perform through multiple intelligences (seven, to be precise, from verbal to kinesthetic and interpersonal). His own and other studies in these areas revealed that students who may be letter-perfect in a school subject such as physics fail spectacularly in transferring that knowledge from classroom exercises to problems in the real world. Even adults abandon book learning and invoke pictures of the world--including stereotypes about the forces of gravity or about skin color--that they constructed as early as five years old. The emperor is exposed as being not only naked but ignorant. If such early childhood ``schema,'' as Piaget called them, are so tenacious, then harness them for learning in the advanced classroom, Gardner advises. He recommends reevaluating the concept of apprenticeships and using the hands-on, multimedia techniques seen in children's museum programs. The developmental theories of Piaget and Chomsky are respectfully challenged, the push to ``cultural literacy'' and ``back to basics'' less respectfully. At issue is the unexamined idea. Gardner calls for schools and teachers to encourage personal ``Christopherian confrontations,'' the encounter between belief and reality that Christopher Columbus presented when he did not sail off the edge of the world. An exciting proposal for restructuring schools in order to guide students to a genuine understanding of the world. A bonus is the extraordinary insight into why children and adults seem to resist learning and why they often behave in such mystifying ways. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

At Radcliffe College she studied under William James, who remained her lifelong friend, and then went to Johns Hopkins to study medicine. Abandoning her studies, she moved to Paris with her brother Leo in 1903. At 27 rue de Fleurus, Gertrude Stein lived with Alice B. Toklas, who would remain her companion for 40 years. Not only was she an innovator in literature and a supporter of modern poetry and art, she was the friend and mentor of those who visited her at her now-famous home: Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Jean Cocteau, Ernest Hemingway, F.

IBM's 360 and Early 370 Systems describes the creation of this remarkable system and the developments it spawned, including its successor, System/370. The authors tell how System/360's widely-copied architecture came into being and how IBM failed in an effort to replace it ten years later with a bold development effort called FS, the Future System. Along the way they detail the development of many computer innovations still in use, among them semiconductor memories, the cache, floppy disks, and Winchester disk files. They conclude by looking at issues involved in managing research and development and striving for product leadership.While numerous anecdotal and fragmentary accounts of System/360 and System/370 development exist, this is the first comprehensive account, a result of research into IBM records, published reports, and interviews with over a hundred participants. Covering the period from about 1960 to 1975, it highlights such important topics as the gamble on hybrid circuits, conception and achievement of a unified product line, memory and storage developments, software support, unique problems at the high end of the line, monolithic integrated circuit developments, and the trend toward terminal-oriented systems.System/360 was developed during the transition from discrete transistors to integrated circuits at the crucial time when the major source of IBM's revenue was changed from punched-card equipment to electronic computer systems. As the authors point out, the key to the system's success was compatibility among its many models. So important was this to customers that System/370 and its successors have remained compatible with System/360. Many companies in fact chose to develop and market their own 360-370 compatible systems. System/360 also spawned an entire industry dedicated to making plug-compatible products for attachment to it.The authors, all affiliated with IBM Research, are coauthors of IBM's Early Computers, a critically acclaimed technical history covering the period before 1960.</p></p><p>An internationally recognized leader in magnetics and computer memory technologies, Emerson W.

This classic collection draws together his key papers. This edition contains a new preface by Professor Bryan S. Turner.</p><p><p>Bryan S. Turner is a leading Weber scholar and contemporary sociologist. He has edited <em>Max Weber: Critical Responses </em>(Routledge 1999) and <em>Max Weber on Economy and Society</em>, with Robert Holton (Routledge 1989), and is the founding editor with John O'Neill of the <em>Journal of Classical Sociology.</em></p>"Weber is essential to an understanding of sociological theory, and this is the quintessential Weber--a gold mine of insights into the workings of society."--Leslie Wasson, University of South Florida<br><br>"Still the best compilation of texts by Weber."--Peter Jelavich, University of Texas, Austin<br><br>"Wonderful....A classic for teaching modern EUuropean intellectual and cultural history."--Marjorie Beale, University of California<br><br>"An excellent collection of papers from Max Weber.

Bringing together a systematic explanation of hadrons, nuclei, and stars for the first time in one volume, Carlos A. Bertulani provides the core material needed by graduate and advanced undergraduate students of physics to acquire a solid understanding of nuclear and particle science. <i>Nuclear Physics in a Nutshell</i> is the definitive new resource for anyone considering a career in this dynamic field.</p><br><p> The book opens by setting nuclear physics in the context of elementary particle physics and then shows how simple models can provide an understanding of the properties of nuclei, both in their ground states and excited states, and also of the nature of nuclear reactions. It then describes: nuclear constituents and their characteristics; nuclear interactions; nuclear structure, including the liquid-drop model approach, and the nuclear shell model; and recent developments such as the nuclear mean-field and the nuclear physics of very light nuclei, nuclear reactions with unstable nuclear beams, and the role of nuclear physics in energy production and nucleosynthesis in stars.</p><br><p> Throughout, discussions of theory are reinforced with examples that provide applications, thus aiding students in their reading and analysis of current literature. Each chapter closes with problems, and appendixes address supporting technical topics.</p></p><p><p>"The particular attraction of this book is the detail with which it provides, in one place, all of the essential physics required for an understanding of the field. An excellent piece of scholarship, it will come to be regarded as an essential text for beginning graduate physics study. Indeed, I know of no other modern treatment other than this that goes to such lengths, and within this context it is indeed a tour de force."<b>--David A. Bradley, University of Surrey</b></p><p>"This book does a fine job of developing three topics--hadrons, nuclei, and stars--that are often covered separately, and bringing them together in an appealing way in the context of real physical systems. Remarkably self-contained, with helpful, unobtrusive appendices, it develops most physical concepts from start to finish. It can be used for a course on stellar physics, nuclear physics, or advanced quantum mechanics."<b>--Savas Dimopoulos, Stanford University</b></p><b>Carlos A.

Building on the very successful <i>Elements of Gas Turbine Propulsion</i>, textbook coverage has been expanded to include rocket propulsion and the material on gas dynamics has been dramatically improved. The text is divided into four parts: basic concepts and gas dynamics; analysis of rocket propulsion systems; parametric (design point) and performance (off-design) analysis of air breathing propulsion systems; and analysis and design of major gas turbine engine components (fans, compressors, turbines, inlets, nozzles, main burners, and afterburners).<br><br>Design concepts are introduced early (aircraft and rocket performance in an introductory chapter) and integrated throughout. Written with extensive student input on the design of the book, the book builds upon definitions and gradually develops the thermodynamics, gas dynamics, rocket engine analysis, and gas turbine engine principles. The book contains over 100 worked examples and numerous homework problems so concepts are applied after they are introduced. Over 600 illustrations and pictures show basic concepts, trends, and design examples.<br><br>Eight computer programs accompany the text, which allow for rapid calculation of trends, &#x201c;what if&#x201d; questions, conceptual design, homework problems, and homework verification. The software runs in the Windows operating system on PC-compatible systems.</p><p>Jack D. Mattingly received his B.S. and M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Notre Dame, and his Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Astronautics at the University of Washington. While studying for his doctorate under Gordon C. Oates, he pioneered research in the mixing of coannular swirling flows and developed a major new test facility. During his 40 years of experience in analysis and design of propulsion and thermodynamic systems, he has written two engineering textbooks, developed aerothermodynamic cycle analysis models, and created engineering software for air-breathing propulsion systems. Dr. Mattingly was previously at the Aero Propulsion Laboratory at Wright-Patterson AFB where he directed exploratory and advanced development programs aimed at improving the performance, reliability, and durability of gas turbine engine components. He retired from active duty with the U.S. Air Force in 1989 and joined the faculty of Seattle University. In 2000 he retired from Seattle University as Professor Emeritus in Mechanical Engineering to dedicate his efforts to writing this textbook and a new edition of Aircraft Engine Design, teaching short courses, and consulting. Dr. Mattingly has more than 35 years of experience in Engineering Education, earlier as a senior member of the Department of Aeronautics at the United States Air Force Academy, where he established a top undergraduate propulsion program. In addition, he has taught and done research in propulsion and thermal energy systems at the Air Force Institute of Technology, University of Washington, University of Notre Dame, University of Wisconsin, and IBM Corp. He was also founder of the AIAA/Air Breathing Propulsion Team Aircraft Engine Design Competition for undergraduate students. Among his many distinguished teaching awards is Outstanding Educator for 1992 from Seattle University. Having published more than 25 technical papers, articles, and textbooks in his field, Dr. Mattingly authored Elements of Gas Turbine Propulsion (1995) and was co-author of Aircraft Engine Design, Second Edition (2002), an unprecedented conceptual design textbook for air breathing engines that won the 2005 AIAA Summerfield Book Award.</p><h2>The Homecoming (Wonderfully Illustrated Short Pieces, 2)</h2><p><p>Illustrated classics for adults!

Also for the first time, WISPs harness the talents of top illustrators for the benefit and delight of a new, older audience.</p><p>This WISP presents Ray Bradbury's The Homecoming, a little boy's tale of his family reunion of vampires. This story was initially published in 1946 and later refashioned into further stories. Bringing this story to life are the wondrous illustrations of Dave McKean, whose delightful artwork perfectly matches the tale.</p><p>These one&#x2013;of&#x2013;a&#x2013;kind, attractively priced and invitingly formatted illustrated editions will make a great impulse buy and appeal to a broad audience.</p></p><p><p>In a career spanning more than seventy years, Ray Bradbury, who died on June 5, 2011 at the age of 91, inspired generations of readers to dream, think, and create. A prolific author of hundreds of short stories and close to fifty books, as well as numerous poems, essays, operas, plays, teleplays, and screenplays, Bradbury was one of the most celebrated writers of our time. His groundbreaking works include <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, <em>The Martian Chronicles</em>, <em>The Illustrated Man</em>, <em>Dandelion Wine</em>, and <em>Something Wicked This Way Comes</em>. He wrote the screen play for John Huston's classic film adaptation of <em>Moby Dick</em>, and was nominated for an Academy Award. He adapted sixty-five of his stories for television's <em>The Ray Bradbury Theater</em>, and won an Emmy for his teleplay of <em>The Halloween Tree</em>. He was the recipient of the 2000 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, the 2004 National Medal of Arts, and the 2007 Pulitzer Prize Special Citation, among many honors.</p><p>Throughout his life, Bradbury liked to recount the story of meeting a carnival magician, Mr. Electrico, in 1932. At the end of his performance Electrico reached out to the twelve-year-old Bradbury, touched the boy with his sword, and commanded, "Live forever!" Bradbury later said, "I decided that was the greatest idea I had ever heard. I started writing every day. I never stopped."</p></p><h2>Palm Springs Confidential: Playground of the Stars!</h2><p>The book takes readers behind the locked gates and inside the bedrooms of more than 500 celebrity homes from Bob Hope, Elizabeth Taylor, and Frank Sinatra to Suzanne Somers.</p><p>Johns, editor-at-large for Palm Springs Life, set out to write a locator guide for stars' homes but instead wound up compiling a gossipy who's who of Palm Springs, Calif., the tony desert community 100 miles from Hollywood that was once was the stomping ground of the big screen's hottest silent stars, screen goddesses, studio moguls and more. As Johns explicates in lurid detail, Palm Springs and its environs was where the rich and famous came to drink and do much more than dance the night away, while hangers-on and has-beens got into even worse trouble. Robert Mitchum opined about his short stay in a local jail after a pot bust in 1949: "It was like Palm Springs, without the riffraff." Johns delights in his tabloid antics, and his range of trivial knowledge about a vast array of movie and TV stars is impressive. Who knew Hollywood legend Kirk Douglas was implicated in the disappearance and death of a starlet in 1949? Or that beloved family man Bob Hope romanced numerous ever-younger women behind the back of his faithful wife of nearly 70 years? To be sure, Johns focuses on the more salacious moments in Palm Springs history: the murder trials of Lana Turner's daughter, Cheryl Crane, and actor Tom Neal; the overdose deaths of Dorothy Dandridge and Alan Ladd; and the bisexual affairs of Cary Grant and Van Johnson. Much of the book is well-researched filler concerning who lived where and is often repetitive. Bitchy and irreverent, this dish isn't very fresh, but Johns serves it with lots of spice and relish, making it a guilty pleasure.

So begins THE INVENTION OF SOLITUDE, Paul Auster&#39;s moving and personal meditation on fatherhood. After the death of his own father, Auster discovers a 60-year-old family murder mystery that could account for the old man&#39;s elusive character. Later the book shifts from Auster&#39;s identity as son to his own role as father.</p><p>Beginning with the deconstructed detective novels of the New York Trilogy, Paul Auster has proved himself to be one of the most adventurous writers in contemporary fiction. In book after book, he seems compelled to reinvent his style from scratch. Yet he always returns to certain preoccupations--most notably, solitude and coincidence--and these themes get a powerful workout in this early memoir. In the first half, &#34;Portrait of an Invisible Man,&#34; Auster comes to terms with the death of his father, and as he investigates this elusive figure, he makes a rather shocking (and enlightening) discovery about his family&#39;s history. The second half, &#34;The Book of Memory,&#34; finds the author on more abstract ground, toying with the entwined metaphors of coincidence, translation, solitude, and language. But here, too, the autobiographical element gives an extra kick to Auster&#39;s prose and keeps him from sliding off into armchair aesthetics. An eloquent, mesmerizing book.Paul Auster was born in Newark, New Jersey in the United States in 1947. He graduated from Columbia University with an MA degree. In 1970 he worked as a merchant seaman on an Esso oil tanker. From 1971 to 1974 he lived in France, spending two years in Paris and one in Provence. After returning to New York in 1974, he began his writing career.Throughout the 1970s he wrote mainly poetry and essays which appeared in various magazines including the New York Review of Books. During the 1980s he concentrated on prose writing: a memoir and four novels were published.His screenplay Smoke and Blue in the Face was published in April 1996 to coincide with the release of the film, and in 1999 Faber published the screenplay Lulu on the Bridge. The Art of Hunger (a collection of essays, interviews and prose) and his Selected Poems were published in November 1998.He is the author of nine novels, including The New York Trilogy&lt;/</p><h2>Foundations of Periodontics for the Dental Hygienist</h2><p>Comprehensive and easy-to-understand, Foundations of Periodontics for the Dental Hygienist, 5th Edition equips dental hygiene students with up-to-date, evidence-based coverage of periodontal anatomy, the periodontal disease process, and classifications of periodontal disease.<br>Rather than presenting information in narrative style, the author&#x2015;a leading expert in the field&#x2015;uses a detailed outline format, making the information easier to read, understand, and reference.

International law can be defined as &#39;the rules governing the legal relationship between nations and states&#39;, but in reality it is much more complex, with political, diplomatic and socio-economic factors shaping the law and its application. This refreshingly clear, concise textbook encourages students to view international law as a dynamic system of organizing the world. Bringing international law back to its first principles, the book is organised around four questions: where does it come from? To whom does it apply? How does it resolve conflict? And what does it say? Building on these questions with both academic rigour and clarity of expression, Professor Klabbers breathes life and energy into the subject. Footnotes point students to the wider academic debate while chapter introductions and final remarks reinforce learning. The second edition has been updated throughout, with particular attention to recent judicial decisions, and features new sections on sovereign debt relief, the prompt release of vessels, and the Antarctic.</p><p>The new and updated edition of this landmark textbook in the teaching of international law, from one of the world&#39;s leading international lawyers, is refreshingly clear and concise, conveying the dynamics of international law through four questions: where does it come from?

As he considers the moral dimensions of climate change, he reasons clearly through what universal standards of goodness and justice require of us, both as citizens and as governments. His conclusions&#x2015;some as demanding as they are logical&#x2015;will challenge and enlighten. Eco-conscious readers may be surprised to hear they have a duty to offset all their carbon emissions, while policy makers will grapple with Broome&#x2019;s analysis of what if anything is owed to future generations. From the science of greenhouse gases to the intricate logic of cap and trade, Broome reveals how the principles that underlie everyday decision making also provide simple and effective ideas for confronting climate change. <em>Climate Matters</em> is an essential contribution to one of the paramount issues of our time.</p><p>John Broome is the White&#39;s Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Oxford. He is also the lead author on Working Group III of the UN&#39;s International Panel on Climate Change.&#x201c;In <em>Climate Matters</em> John Broome brings his lucid writing, sparkling insights, and deep moral seriousness to the greatest moral challenge of our time. This is practical ethics at its most brilliant and its most significant.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Peter Singer, Ira W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics, Princeton University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Climate Matters</em> takes up where most books about global warming leave off. John Broome writes clearly and thoughtfully about the most pressing questions of our time.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Elizabeth Kolbert, author of Field Notes from a Catastrophe</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Broome applies ethical principles logically to private moral behavior and sound government policy on climate change, with interesting and sometimes surprising results. I want to argue with some of it, and climate change is worth arguing about.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ross Garnaut, former climate change advisor for the Australian government</strong><br><br>&#x201c;How refreshing to have John Broome, an economist, argue that we should incorporate ethics in climate policy formation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Lester R. Brown, president of Earth Policy Institute and author of World on the Edge</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Unmanaged climate change raises profound ethical, policy, and personal issues which must be faced directly. John Broome, one of the outstanding moral philosophers of our times, presents the issues and his conclusions in a most thoughtful, accessible, practical, and compelling way. A vitally important contribution.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Nicholas Stern, president of the British Academy and chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics</strong><br><br>&#x201c;For me (and for many others, I suspect) it is important to see this ethical side of climate change examined carefully by a skilled philosopher.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Martin Weitzman, Professor of Economics, Harvard University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;John Broome is uniquely qualified to help us think through some of the more important questions. His new book is sometimes controversial and surprising, but always insightful and clear.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>James Garvey, <em>the Times Literary Supplement</em></strong></p><h2>Evolution&#39;s Workshop: God And Science On The Galapagos Islands</h2><p>More than any other place on Earth, the Galapagos Islands are the workshop of evolution. Isolated and desolate, they were largely overlooked by early explorers until Charles Darwin arrived there in the 1830s. It was Darwin who recognized that Galapagos&#39; isolation and desolation were advantages: the paucity of species and lack of outside influences made the workings of natural selection crystal clear. Since then, every important advance and controversy in evolutionary thinking has had its reflection on the Galapagos. In every sense-intellectually, institutionally, and culturally-the history of science on these islands is a history of the way evolutionary science was done for the past 150 years. Evolution&#39;s Workshop tells the story of Darwin&#39;s explorations there; the fabulous Gilded Age expeditions, run from rich men&#39;s gigantic yachts, that featured rough-and-ready science during the day and black-tie dinners every night; the struggle for control of research on the Galapagos; the current efforts by &#34;creation scientists&#34; to use the Galapagos to undercut evolutionary teaching; and many other compelling stories.</p><p>When Europeans first explored the Galapagos Islands, a rugged archipelago 650 miles off the coast of Ecuador, they were astounded by the forbidding landscape and the odd behavior of the animals and plants they found there. "The place is like a new creation," wrote ship captain George Anson, a nephew of the poet Lord Byron. "The birds and beasts do not get out of our way; the pelicans and sea-lions look in our faces as if we had no right to intrude on their solitude; the small birds are so tame that they hop upon our feet; and all this amidst volcanoes which are burning around us on either hand."<p> Others who followed, like the onetime sailor and writer Herman Melville, took a dimmer view, calling the place "evilly enchanted ground." Whatever the sentiment, the Galapagos attracted generations of scientists, who, following the example of Charles Darwin, traveled there to test theories of speciation, adaptation, migration, and selection. Their work in the field helped overturn the prevailing orthodoxies of special creation, writes Edward J. Larson in his vigorous history of the islands and their role in the development of modern biological science. Their work also changed the face of the islands themselves, as hundreds and thousands of plants and animals were killed or removed for collections far afield, with a single expedition taking more than 10,000 birds and skins.</p><p> Today, the islands face other threats, as tens of thousands of ecotourists travel there each year, disturbing sensitive environments, and as alien plant and animal species are introduced. Still, Larson notes at the close of his fine book, "the archipelago's ecosystem has proved surprisingly resilient in the past," and conservation measures may yet be found to preserve the islands' "age-old solitude." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Edward J.

Beginning with the&nbsp;initial considerations, this handbook offers proven, step-by-step advice for developing and packaging the components of a business plan&#x2014;cover sheet, table of contents, executive summary,&nbsp;description of the business,&nbsp;organizational and marketing plans, and financial and supporting documents&#x2014;and for keeping the plan up-to-date. Four&nbsp;real-life business plans and blank forms and worksheets provide readers with additional user-friendly guidelines for the creation of the plans. This updated seventh edition features new chapters on financing resources and business planning for nonprofits as well as a sample restaurant business plan.</p></p><p>Thank you for choosing <i>Anatomy of a Business Plan</i> as the tool to help you write your business plan. I think you will be pleased with this new edition. <p>It has often been said that, "You can run your business by the seat of your pants--but you will probably end up with torn pants." One of the principal reasons for business failure is the lack of an adequate business plan. In today's world, both small and large businesses have come to understand that they need to take the time to evaluate their business potential and map a plan for the future. It is also understood that lenders and investors no longer risk their money on a business unless they have good reason to think that it will be successful (i.e., profitable). </p><p>It is the goal of this book to give you a clear, concise, and easy-to-understand process to follow as you develop your business plan. I have been working with business owners for many years and most of them have the same problem--they are experts in their industries, but are novices when it comes to business planning. In fact, many times, the prospect of writing a business plan is so formidable that business owners avoid it until it becomes a requirement for one reason or another. </p><p>I, on the other hand, am not an expert in your industry. My job is to guide you step-by-step through the business planning process. If I am successful, you can follow that process, apply your industry expertise, and write a winning business plan for your company. </p><p>Who is this book for? I frequently get asked if <i>Anatomy of a Business Plan</i> is appropriate for a big business or a tiny business--a start-up business or an existing business--high tech or low tech--a business seeking funding or a business looking for an internal planning tool--a product business or a service business--a restaurant or a technology business--a sole proprietorship or a corporation--or a division within a company. The answer is that it is the right book for all of the above. No matter who you are, the business planning process is the same. </p><p>It is your focus that differs. If you are a smaller business and your business plan is intended only for internal use, your plan may be shorter and you may choose to address only certain issues. On the other hand, if your business is larger and more complex, you will probably need to put key people to work on the development of a more critical business plan that will be in keeping with your company vision. </p><p>If you need funding, you will have to consider the goals of the lender or investor and address those issues. If you are a new business, you will only have projections. If you are an existing business, you will also have historical information. If you are a pure service business, you have no cost of goods. If you are a product business, you do. If you are high tech or low tech, the process is still the same. The variable is how you focus on your specific industry. </p><p>The simplification of your business planning task has always been the primary goal of <i>Anatomy of a Business Plan</i>. In order to get the most out of the book and to make your job easier, I would suggest that the first thing you do is read the book to give you a general overview of the format and content. After reading, you will be ready to begin working your way through the actual business planning process. </p><p>Example Business Plans </p><p>In the back of the book (Appendix I, II, III, and IV) you will find four full-length business plan examples that are for four different kinds of business. All four were written by the business owners and/or consultants they worked with. The common tools that they used were <i>Anatomy of a Business Plan</i> and its companion software, <i>Automate Your Business Plan</i>. </p><p>* Marine Art of California is a start-up product business. The plan is for a sole proprietorship dealing in fine art pieces. The owner is seeking short-time limited partners and plans to recapture 100% ownership within about four years. We have added a possible one-year history for this business to show what might have happened during its first year. <br>* Dayne Landscaping, Inc. is a one-year-old landscaping and snow removal (service) business. It is a small corporation, seeking to expand into new territories. Dayne Landscaping, Inc. is planning to seek funding from a traditional lending institution (bank). <br>* Wholesale Mobile Homes.com, Inc. is a dot.com bricks and clicks start-up corporation planning to go after $10 million in venture capital. Because the business is more complex and is seeking venture capital, the executive summary, and the organizational and marketing plans are researched more heavily and written in more detail. <br>* Karma Jazz Cafï¿½ is an upscale restaurant that is scheduled to open in early 2008 in Fort Worth, Texas. This is the owner's second location of the same restaurant. The first Karma Jazz Cafï¿½ is in Atlanta, GA and is successfully up and running. The newest restaurant is considered to be a start-up business, but is patterned on and utilizes projected and historical financial information and other knowledge gained from the Atlanta location. </p><p>The interesting thing about the four plans is that they were researched and written by different people. As you read them, you will find that each of the writers brings something new and different into the planning process that will prove valuable to you in your own efforts. </p><p>Thank you again for choosing <i>Anatomy of a Business Plan</i> to help you accomplish your goal. I appreciate your confidence in <i>Anatomy of a Business Plan</i> and wish you success in the writing of your business plan! </p><p>Linda Pinson</p><b>The Complete Business Planning Tool!</b> <p>Award-winning author and consultant Linda Pinson has empowered more than a million businesses with her book, <i>Anatomy of a Business Plan</i>.

More than a century ago, it was established as an Arts and Crafts colony in the heart of the Catskill Mountains. Craftsmen, writers, and musicians came, lured by the atmosphere of creativity amid like-minded people. Furniture, pottery, paintings, metalwork, and textiles were all made there, and the people themselves became an interwoven part of the fabric of the place. This book is the story of the first years of the colony, the artists who visited, and the artistic community they fostered.</p><p>Illustrated with 200 images and featuring essays by noted scholars in the fields of American art history and the Arts and Crafts movement, this book traces the origins of Byrdcliffe as nothing less than the cultural nucleus of one of America's most legendary small towns. Edited by curator Nancy E. Green, this catalog accompanied a 2004 exhibition organized by the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University.</p></p><p><p>Nancy E. Green is The Gale and Ira Drukier Curator of European and American Art, Prints &amp; Drawings, 1800&#x2013;1945 at the Herbert F.

Did principles of religious freedom and local self-government protect Mormons' claim to a distinct, religiously based legal order? Or was polygamy, as its opponents claimed, a new form of slavery--this time for white women in Utah? And did constitutional principles dictate that democracy and true liberty were founded on separation of church and state? <br><br>As Sarah Barringer Gordon shows, the answers to these questions finally yielded an apparent victory for antipolygamists in the late nineteenth century, but only after decades of argument, litigation, and open conflict. Victory came at a price; as attention and national resources poured into Utah in the late 1870s and 1880s, antipolygamists turned more and more to coercion and punishment in the name of freedom. They also left a legacy in constitutional law and political theory that still governs our treatment of religious life: Americans are free to believe, but they may well not be free to act on their beliefs.<br><br></p><p>"[Gordon] deftly handles complicated issues of religion, states' rights, constitutional theory, and the separation of church and state. . . . [She] does an outstanding job of clarifying complex legal issues and demonstrating change over time. . . . Gordon is a fine scholar whose penetrating research and interdisciplinary approach break new ground in the fields of Mormon studies and legal history."-- <i>Publishers Weekly</i> <br>In the first book to explore the significance of the nineteenth-century campaign to criminalize Mormon polygamy, Gordon traces how the antipolygamy movement was mobilized and the ways in which it transformed American constitutional law and church-state relations.</p><h2>Abriendo Paso: Gramatica</h2><p>Book by PRENTICE HALL</p><p></p><h2>What Nerve!: Alternative Figures in American Art, 1960 to the Present</h2><p><i>What Nerve!</i> reveals a hidden history of American figurative painting, sculpture and popular imagery. It documents and/or restages four installations, spaces or happenings, in Chicago, San Francisco, Detroit and Providence, which were crucial to the development of figurative art in the United States. Several of the better-known artists in <i>What Nerve!</i> have been the subject of significant exhibitions or publications, but this is the first major volume to focus on the broader impact of figurative art to connect artists and collectives from different generations and regions of the country. These are: from Chicago, the Hairy Who (James Falconer, Art Green, Gladys Nilsson, Jim Nutt, Suellen Rocca, Karl Wirsum); from California, Funk artists (Jeremy Anderson, Robert Arneson, Roy De Forest, Robert Hudson, Ken Price, Peter Saul, Peter Voulkos, William T. Wiley); from Detroit, Destroy All Monsters (Mike Kelley, Cary Loren, Niagara, Jim Shaw); and from Providence, Forcefield (Mat Brinkman, Jim Drain, Leif Goldberg, Ara Peterson). Created in collaboration with artists from these groups, the historical moments at the core of <i>What Nerve!</i> are linked by work from six artists who profoundly influenced or were influenced by the groups: William Copley, Jack Kirby, Elizabeth Murray, Gary Panter, Christina Ramberg and H.C. Westermann. Featuring paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, photographs and videos, as well as ephemera, wallpaper and other materials used in the reconstructed installations, the book and exhibition will broaden public exposure to the scope of this influential history. The exuberance, humor and politics of these artworks remain powerfully resonant. Much of the work in this book, including installation photos, exhibition ephemera and correspondence, is published for the first time. <i>What Nerve!</i> represents the first historical examination of the circumstances, relationships and works of an increasingly important lineage of American artists.</p><p>I walked away from the show sensing that these artists were not experimenting but refining fully formed aesthetics...What they produced wasn&#x2019;t high or low imagery, but publics and taste that were wholly their own. (William S. Smith <i>Art in America</i>)<br><br>This show, along with the excellent catalog...teems with ideas that other curators should build on. (Roberta Smith <i>The New York Times</i>)<br><br>It&#x2019;s wonderful how authentic, vital, and even inspiring their whippersnapper principles feel, fifty years later. (Peter Schjeldahl <i>The New Yorker</i>)<br><br>A demonstration of how widly diverse the range of sub-cultural artistry has always been outside of the dominant New York art world. (Matthew Erickson <i>Frieze</i>)<br><br>This published companion to an exhibition of the same title at the Rhode Island School of Design's museum of Art in Providence connects some widely spaced dots. Starting with the figurative artists of the "Hairy Who" in Chicago and West Coast Funk artists and their assorted allies, it recontextualizes painters as various as William N. Copley, Elizabeth Murray and Gary Panter; encompasses the rogue artist/musicians of Destroy All Monsters; and concludes with the erstwhile Providence collective Forcefield. It may not make total sense, but it greatly broadens the view beyond the usual academic and market suspects. (Holland Cotter <i>The New York Times</i>)<br><br>"What Nerve!" opens up the narrow trajectory of art history into a dizzying knot of possible interconnections and influences, suggesting the shapes and lines formed by art history are works of art in themselves. (Priscilla Frank <i>Huffington Post</i>)<br><br>Generally speaking, the art is grotesque, garish and exuberant, cranky, sometimes menacing, often hilarious and, in the case of the Hairy Who and Destroy All Monsters, particularly fresh. (J. Hoberman <i>The New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br>This focus on early works catches the artists when they were young, feeding off the creative energies of their comrades and responding most nakedly to their historical times. (Ken Johnson <i>The New York Times</i>)<br><br>I found &#x201c;What Nerve!&#x201d; hugely stimulating. Not only because it&#x2019;s filled with brilliant and original work, but because it&#x2019;s also sprinkled liberally with clunkers &#x2015; truly groan-inducing, deeply ordinary art. As a result, the show gives your critical criteria a really good workout. Better yet, it raises such interesting questions. Does art thrive in collectivist settings? Is the energy of groups more productive &#x2015; or just more viable in the worldly sense &#x2015; than the heat given off by solitary creators? Is the collective, as an expression of youthful idealism, an end in itself? Or is it, at best, a kind of shell protecting creative individuals in their embryonic stages, best broken out of?

That ring of authenticity comes clearly from the mind and craft of an artist at work. For the contemporary reader, the novel provides a glimpse of an immigrant society, a culture in exile, and the immigrants' responses to the social scene... Drawing on the realistic and naturalistic trends in Europe and in America, Janson has written an American novel that anticipates the works of such writers as Theodore Dreiser, Stephen Crane, and Sarah Orne Jewett."&#x2015;from the Preface by Gerald Thorson</p><p>First published in Norwegian by a Minneapolis firm in 1887, Drude Krog Janson's <i>A Saloonkeeper's Daughter</i> has been sadly neglected in the history of American literature, despite its unusually forward-looking portrayal of a self-reliant, career-minded woman and its importance within America's regional and urban literary traditions. Janson's lyrical coming-of-age novel tells the story of the pensive, beautiful Astrid Holm, forced by her family's bankruptcy to abandon a comfortable, middle-class life in Norway for a harsh, new existence in Minneapolis living in an apartment above her father's saloon. She attempts to escape this hardship through art (as an actress) and love (entering into an unhappy relationship with a brutish lawyer) until she finds her true calling as a Unitarian minister and fulfills her longing for meaningful companionship with Helene Nielsen, a selfless doctor to poor immigrants. With this edition of <i>A Saloonkeeper's Daughter</i>, an important and prescient work of American fiction is finally available in English.</p></p><p><p><b>Drude Krog Janson </b> (1846-1934) emigrated to Minneapolis in 1882 with her six children to be with her husband, Kristofer Janson, a Unitarian minister and prolific author. Active in the women's suffrage movement, she wrote numerous articles for the Norwegian-American press. Returning to Europe in 1893, she published three more novels and divorced her husband. She died in Copenhagen. <b>Gerald Thorson </b> (1921-2001) was a professor of English at St. Olaf College and a pioneer in the study of Scandinavian-American literature. <b>Orm ï¿½verland </b> is a professor of English at the University of Bergen, Norway.</p><p>"An intriguing book... The novel realistically details middle-class life in the Norwegian-American immigrant community in 1870s Minneapolis."</p> (Clarence Mondale <i>American Studies International</i>)<br><br><p>"At last available in an English translation, this Norwegian American historical novel... tells the story of the beautiful Astrid, an immigrant who struggles to find her way to independence and faith. Janson was 36 when she came to the U.S., and in this novel she vividly evokes the tough life in Minneapolis and the landscape of Norway and Minnesota... Highly recommended for all libraries."</p> (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p>"Drude Krog Janson lived an incredibly fascinating life, at the center of which was the struggle for women's rights. This is also true of her first novel, which follows a woman through adversity and struggle in a man's world and a class-conscious culture, until she finds her own identity as a free and independent human being... Today the novel is of interest both for its historical setting and as an early and daring attempt to tell the story of a young woman who has the strength and the courage to choose to live a full life without compromise. The novel may also make you wish to find out more about the author: a very many-faceted and productive woman who had an impact both in Norway and abroad."</p> (Hans H. Skei <i>Aftenposten (Oslo)</i>)<br><br><p>"<i>A Saloonkeeper's Daughter</i> is fascinating and enjoyable reading... The novel is a lyrical female coming-of-age story, realistically portraying the protagonist's struggles while showing women who create successful intellectual and emotional lives for themselves in a male-dominated society."</p> (Solveig Zempel <i>Journal of American Ethnic History</i>)<br><br><p>"This strong American novel... is above all else a women's liberation treatise that is universally applicable...

The primary purpose is to instruct the reader in theoretical approaches to the modelling and analysis of interactions, whilst simultaneously providing physical explanations of their dependence upon the parameters of the coupled systems. It is primarily to the engineering student that the book is addressed, in the firm belief that a good engineer remains a student throughout his professional life. A preoccupation with the relevance and validity of theoretical analyses in relation to practical problems is a hallmark of results obtained from theoretical analysis of idealized models and the behaviour of the less than ideal realities from which they are abstracted.</p><p>Extensively revised; now covering the fundamental aspects and modern developments in vibroacousticsThe various phenomena associated with wave motion in solid structures, and its coupling to surrounding fluids, are of central importance to the engineer concerned with sound radiation from vibrating structures, sound transmission across partitions, and the response of structures to sound, processes which are of great practical concern in noise control. This advanced textbook presents a unified approach to the analysis of audio-frequency vibration in coupled solid-fluid systems in which the role of waves in both media is emphasized.<br>The book is primarily intended to instruct the reader in theoretical approaches to the modelling and analysis of fluid structure interactions; but, in order to cater for the less mathematically inclined student, it provides extensive physical explanations of their dependence upon the parameters of the coupled systems. Numerous examples of the behaviour of practical systems are presented and, to aid self study, worked solutions are provided for the questions which follow each chapter. Over 100 source references are provided for further reading.</p><h2>The History of North American Small Gas Turbine Aircraft Engines (Library of Flight)</h2><p>This joint publication between the National Air and Space Museum and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics chronicles the evolution of the small gas turbine engine via a comprehensive study of a major aerospace industry.

What can it teach us about our future? </b></p><p>According to the Jewish mystical tradition of Kabbalah,<em> Ehyeh,</em> or "I shall be," is the deepest, most hidden name of God. Arthur Green, one of the most respected teachers of Jewish mysticism of his generation, uses this simple Hebrew word to unlock the spiritual meaning of Kabbalah for our lives.</p><blockquote><p>When Moses experienced his great moment of call at the Burning Bush, he asked God, &#x201c;When people ask me, 'What is His name?' what should I say to them?&#x201d; God answers with this mysterious phrase, &#x201c;I shall be what I shall be,&#x201d; and says to Moses, &#x201c;Tell them that &#x2018;I shall be&#x2019; sent you.&#x201d;<br>God&#x2019;s puzzling answer makes the conversation sound like a koan-dialogue between a Zen master and disciple.... Like the koan, the text here is reaching to some place beyond words, seeking to create a breakthrough in our consciousness. What is it trying to tell us?<br>&#x2015;from the Introduction</p></blockquote><p>Blending Jewish theology and mysticism, Arthur Green invites us on a contemporary exploration of Kabbalah, showing how the ancient Jewish mystical tradition can be retooled to address the needs of our generation.</p><p>Drawing on the <em>Zohar </em>and other kabbalistic texts, Green examines the fundamental ideas and spiritual teachings of Kabbalah, encouraging today&#x2019;s modern seeker to stretch to new ways of thinking with both heart and mind, setting us on a rewarding path to the wisdom Kabbalah has to offer.</p></p><p><p><strong>Arthur Green, PhD,</strong> is recognized as one of the world's preeminent authorities on Jewish thought and spirituality. He is the Irving Brudnick professor of philosophy and religion at Hebrew College and rector of the Rabbinical School, which he founded in 2004. Professor emeritus at Brandeis University, he also taught at the University of Pennsylvania and the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, where he served as dean and president.</p> <p>Dr. Green is author of several books including <em>Judaism's Ten Best Ideas: A Brief Guide for Seeker</em>s; <em>Ehyeh: A Kabbalah for Tomorrow</em>;<em> Seek My Face: A Jewish Mystical Theology</em>;<em> Your Word Is Fire: The Hasidic Masters on Contemplative Prayer</em> and <em>Tormented Master: The Life and Spiritual Quest of Rabbi Nahman of Bratslav</em> (all Jewish Lights). He is also author of <em>Radical Judaism</em> (Yale University Press) and coauthor of <em>Speaking Torah: Spiritual Teachings from around the Maggid's Table.</em> He is long associated with the Havurah movement and a neo-Hasidic approach to Judaism.</p><p>"If you read this as I did, with a pen in hand, underlining sentences and writing 'Yes!' in the margins each time your heart echoes back a resounding confirmation, you will end up as I did, with a completely underlined book, an uplifted heart, renewed zeal&#x2015;and instructions&#x2015;for the spiritual practice of life."<br> &#x2015;<strong>Sylvia Boorstein</strong>, author of <em>Pay Attention, for Goodness' Sake</em></p> <p></p> <p>"Arthur Green rescues Kabbalah from fundamentalists on the one hand and faddists on the other. Drawing on forty years of intense textual study and profound inner search, he fashions a revolutionary Kabbalah for those who yearn for a genuine spirituality, who cherish both heart and mind."<br> &#x2015;<strong>Daniel C. Matt</strong>, author of <em>Zohar: Annotated &amp; Explained</em></p> <p>&#x201c;If you only have time to read one book on Jewish mysticism, this is it. Arthur Green, surely one of the great teachers of our generation, has brought the Kabbalah (back) to life. His book is informed, passionate and wise.

Upon taking command of America's Southern Army in 1780, Nathanael Greene was handed troops that consisted of 1,500 starving, nearly naked men. Gerald Carbone&nbsp;explains how within a year,&nbsp;the small worn-out army ran the British troops out of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina and into&nbsp;the final&nbsp;trap at Yorktown. Despite his huge military successes and&nbsp;tactical genius&nbsp;Greene's story has a dark side.&nbsp;Gerald Carbone drew on 25 years of reporting and researching experience to create his&nbsp;chronicle of&nbsp;Greene's unlikely rise to success and his fall into debt and anonymity. </p><br></p><p><br><br><b>Gerald M.

Price, award-winning author of <i>Freedom's Altar</i> and of <i>Nor the Battle to the Strong</i><br>&nbsp;<br><br>"Ged Carbone has written a lively, accessible&nbsp;biography of one of the truly great strategists in American history, Major General Nathanael Greene,&nbsp;second only to Washington in the pantheon of heroes of the War of the&nbsp;Revolution." --John Buchanan, author of <i>The Road to Guilford Courthouse</i><br>"Nathanael Greene remains one of the American Revolution's most compelling yet unsung heroes. In <i>Nathanael Greene</i> Gerald Carbone provides a complex and absorbing portrait of a resourceful general, a devoted husband, an unfortunate businessman and an ardent American patriot. Carbone cleary admires his subject but also portrays his&nbsp;all-too-human human sides. Well-researched, the&nbsp;general's story is told against a backdrop of dramatic battle scenes, wonderful characters and revolution that seems on the verge of collapse if not for the extraordinary sacrifices of figures such as Greene, to whom all Americans will be forever indebted."--Mark Puls, award-winning author of <i>Samuel Adams</i> and of <i>Henry Knox</i><br><br><i></i>&nbsp;<br><p>&#x201c;With a journalist&#x2019;s eye for telling anecdote and pithy, but illuminating, quotation, Ged Carbone makes Nathanael Greene come alive in this lively, readable biography that is also very good history.&#x201d; --Dennis Conrad, Editor, Papers of General Nathanael Greene</p><br></p><h2>Greek Art And Archaeology</h2><p>For freshman/sophomore-level courses in (Introduction to) Greek Art, Greek Archaeology, and Greek Civilization, found in both Art History and Classics Departments.

The capstone event, a two-week conference in Mexico City, was dubbed by organizers and journalists as "the greatest consciousness-raising event in history." The event drew an all-star cast of characters, including Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, Iranian Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, and US feminist Betty Friedan, as well as a motley array of policymakers, activists, and journalists. <br><br>International Women's Year, the first book to examine this critical moment in feminist history, starts by exploring how organizers juggled geopolitical rivalries and material constraints amid global political and economic instability. The story then dives into the action in Mexico City, including conflicts over issues ranging from abortion to Zionism. The United Nations provided indispensable infrastructure and support for this encounter, even as it came under fire for its own discriminatory practices. While participants expressed dismay at levels of discord and conflict, Jocelyn Olcott explores how these combative, unanticipated encounters generated the most enduring legacies, including women's networks across the global south, greater attention to the intersectionalities of marginalization, and the arrival of women's micro-credit on the development scene.<br><br>This watershed moment in transnational feminism, colorfully narrated in International Women's Year, launched a new generation of activist networks that spanned continents, ideologies, and generations.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jocelyn Olcott</strong> is associate professor of History and Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies at Duke University. She is the author of <em>Revolutionary Women in Postrevolutionary Mexico</em> and the co-editor of <em>Sex in Revolution: Gender, Politics, and Power in Modern Mexico</em>.<br><br>"Jocelyn Olcott has made a terrific contribution to womens history and the history of transnational feminism. <em>International Womens Year</em> is based on a mountain of research that, as far as I can tell, no one else has even attempted in small part. Olcott attacks her subject from as many angles as imaginablerunning down details; opening up space for multiple inferences, contradictory interpretations, and unresolvable complexity; following through with evidence-based assessments of impact, meaning, and significance; and concluding with a sophisticated and truly enlightening discussion of the theoretical conundrums underpinning the writing of women's history and the methodological challenges of transnational historical research. It is social-political-cultural transnational feminist history at its very best. Every historian of feminism will want to read this work; every transnational feminist organizer will thank her for it." -- Tracey Jean Boisseau, <em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Olcott's detailed study of 1970s feminism... is a global reading set within the wider geo-political and regional divisions as they were shaped and, in turn, impacted the UN commitment to transnational human rights and humanitarian change." -- Jean H. Quataert, <em>Journal of Social History</em><p></p><br>"The book's concise and accessible prose makes it a must-read for anyone interested in feminist or gender studies, while the various conceptual bridges it constructs across several fields should make it of particular interest to scholars working on the Non-Aligned Movement, NGO organizations, and the Cold War." -- DAVID YEE, doctoral candidate in Philosophy at the University of Turku, Finland, <em>Global Histories</em><p></p><br>"This essential book, meticulously researched and elegantly written, captures a key historical moment in the development of transnational feminism. Olcott recounts the politics that led to the creation of the 1975 'International Women's Year' in a way that reclaims the significance of the now-vanished 'Second World' of the Cold War era....Undoing the dominant narrative of this UN event as a 'failure,' Olcott shows the continuation of such conferences up to Beijing to be a crucial success constructed in and through this first event. By following the money and exploring contestation as well as celebration, the study illuminates the complexity of NGO-ization for feminist movements. Necessary for every serious research library, but great reading for any student of transnational history, feminism, or non-governmental organization. Essential."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"No issues more clearly defined the 1970s than the changing status of women and the global struggle for economic justice and national liberation. These two collided at the 1975 International Women's Year conference in Mexico City, producing a spectacular display of both solidarity and conflict. Jocelyn Olcott provides the definitive history of this definitive transnational event."--Tim Borstelmann, author of <em>The 1970s</em><p></p><br>"Through Jocelyn Olcott's prodigious research and vivid narrative, a two-week conference in Mexico City in 1975 becomes a lens for viewing the history of transnational organizing among women in the late twentieth century. Historians and activists alike have much to learn from the tumultuous events that paved the way for so much that followed."--Leila J. Rupp, author of <em>Worlds of Women: The Making of an International Women's Movement</em><p></p><br>"Jocelyn Olcott's terrific account of the International Women's Year conference in Mexico City makes readers feel like they are right in the thick of a key moment in feminist history. Deeply researched and told in compelling detail, Olcott's narrative shows how the interactions and dialogue forged in Mexico City laid the basis for the next several decades of global feminist activism."--Susan Ware, General Editor, American National Biography<p></p><br>"A well-paced narrative...[that] adds substantially to the historiography of women on a global stage...Olcott...suggests that unity was never the objective [of the conference]-that the many moments of discord during the proceedings were actually productive. They left indelible impressions on the participants and revealed shared experiences of gender discrimination that transcended nationality and culture...Olcott explains that International Women's Year also left institutional structures in place...[and] galvanized countless governments to form national commissions on women, which, in turn, fostered a burgeoning over four decades of tens of thousands of grassroots NGOs that work across sectors all over the world."--Ellen Chesler, <em>Women's Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"A major contribution of the book is Olcott's documentation in evocative prose of the arduous work of feminist activist methodology: listening to grassroots women with varied political perspectives; building agendas through debate and compromise to ensure policy impact during official conferences; and networking and developing sustained friendships to continue the work beyond the UN. She also valuable elucidates the recent but little-known history of how women's thinking affected global policy frameworks...This rich account of the IWY's global feminist generativity may inspire equally creative future scholarship exploring the relationship between feminist theory and practice, as well as the politics of feminist memory. More importantly...the book offers protection against the cyclical erasure of women's activist history."--Debra L. Schultz, <em>Journal of American History</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Fear: The History of a Political Idea</h2><p>For many commentators, September 11 inaugurated a new era of fear. But as Corey Robin shows in his unsettling tour of the Western imagination--the first intellectual history of its kind--fear has shaped our politics and culture since time immemorial. <br> From the Garden of Eden to the Gulag Archipelago to today's headlines, Robin traces our growing fascination with political danger and disaster. As our faith in positive political principles recedes, he argues, we turn to fear as the justifying language of public life. We may not know the good, but we do know the bad. So we cling to fear, abandoning the quest for justice, equality, and freedom. But as fear becomes our intimate, we understand it less. In a startling reexamination of fear's greatest modern interpreters--Hobbes, Montesquieu, Tocqueville, and Arendt--Robin finds that writers since the eighteenth century have systematically obscured fear's political dimensions, diverting attention from the public and private authorities who sponsor and benefit from it. For fear, Robin insists, is an exemplary instrument of repression--in the public and private sector. Nowhere is this politically repressive fear--and its evasion--more evident than in contemporary America. In his final chapters, Robin accuses our leading scholars and critics of ignoring "Fear, American Style," which, as he shows, is the fruit of our most prized inheritances--the Constitution and the free market. <br> With danger playing an increasing role in our daily lives and justifying a growing number of government policies, Robin's <em>Fear</em> offers a bracing, and necessary, antidote to our contemporary culture of fear.</p><p><br><strong>Corey Robin</strong> teaches political science at Brooklyn College, City University of New York. His writings have appeared in <em>The New York Times Magazine, The Washington Post, Raritan, Dissent, The Times Literary Supplement</em> and <em>American Political Science Review</em>.<br><br>"Robin's account of the place of fear in American life is refreshingly clear--and timely."--Tony Judt, <em>New York Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"Nuanced and skillful...Robin's book suggests that the politics of fear and the long shadows cast by Guantanamo Bay detention camps and the Patriot Act's scope are not simply the result of a government that is out of control or a president who thinks that he's Gary Cooper in 'High Noon.'.... It arises out of liberalism's own paradoxical nature and attests to the deep ambivalence that we...exhibit in confronting fear."--Benjamin Barber, <em>Los Angeles Times</em><p></p><br>"By means of an innovative rereading of four influential political theorists--Thomas Hobbes, Montesquieu, Alexis de Tocqueville and Hannah Arendt--Corey Robin offers a fascinating analysis of how we have formed many of our ideas about the role of fear in society."--<em>New Statesman</em><p></p><br>"A thoughtful, often brilliant, radical polemic against the insufficiencies and pitfalls of liberalism.... Let us hope that in his next work he will try to construct a defense against political fear as spirited as this provocative and discouraging dissection of its multiple forms."--Stanley Hoffman, <em>Foreign Affairs</em><p></p><br>"His book is an appeal for social democracy which American intellectuals and the political elite have abandoned since the New Deal.... With great lucidity, Robin identifies many disturbing excesses in thought and travesties in deed, all of which are bound up in some way with fear." --Michael Kimmage, <em>New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"A compelling book, an antidote to the present-day intellectual and political discourse. Important reading for political theorists, journalists, college students, and intelligent political leaders.... Highly recommended."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"What's most troubling about Robin's analysis of the emotional landscape of the American workplace is the implication that it conditions Americans to see sadism as a natural characteristic of politics. With increasing support for the death penalty, widespread tolerance of the abuse inflicted on prisoners of war at Abu Ghraib, and the Patriot Act's curtailing of civil rights, the publication of <em>Fear: The History of a Political Idea</em> could not be more relevant or timely."--Jane Credland, <em>Tikkun</em><p></p><br>"Learned and original, Robin argues that whereas Hobbes and Arendt appreciated the political dimensions of fear, Montesquieu and Tocqueville relegated the idea to the realm of the psychological--a view of fear that has endured, blinding us to the self-serving ways elites deploy fear for political ends. Along the way, Robin delivers trenchant and original critiques of writers who deal with fear. The journalists Michael Ignatieff, Philip Gourevitch and their ilk, who have made a cottage industry of condemning genocide, come under withering criticism for implicitly romanticizing the mass killings they deplore.... When...Robin takes on a congealed conventional wisdom, he is at his best."--<em>Newsday</em><p></p><br>"Given daily terror alerts and news reports of violence, Robin, professor of political science and contributor to <em>New York Times Magazine</em>, offers a sober analysis of fear's Janus-faced potential as a catalyst for economic progress and the raison d'tre of repressive regimes. A brilliant synthesis of historical perspective and the critically revealing story of 'Fear, American Style,' the account explores the classics of political thought by Hobbes, Montesquieu and Tocqueville and the portrayal of evil by Arendt."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Brilliant.... What he does in <em>Fear</em> is show us, by carefully plotting the progress of modern fear politics from the Enlightenment to present day, that we are as dependent on fear as a political vehicle, if not more so, as we are the charades of left/right/middle factionalism."--<em>National Post</em><p></p><br>"Liberalism, he insists, sends working men and women unprotected into battle against the forces of privilege, a battle they are bound to lose. Defeating fear, US-style, requires a new politics that actively confronts power rather than the current apologetic, ameliorative American liberalism. He may not be right that only a strong state can protect its citizens from fear (which is what, with Hobbes, he ends up arguing), but he makes a strong case that the job is too important to be left to the market."--<em>Financial Times</em><p></p><br>"Fear is a central, but little investigated, concept in modern political thought. In a deft and well-written analysis of this crucial concept and its political implications, Corey Robin not only gives us a masterful survey of its history but also of its abuse by the Bush administration. Passionate, erudite, and partisan, this book is an original contribution to our political vocabulary."--Seyla Benhabib, Eugene Meyer Professor of Political Science and Philosophy, Yale University<p></p><br>"In the wake of 9/11, no emotion is more central to our politics and none is more misunderstood than fear. Corey Robin manages to strip bare the role fear plays in our political lives. His historical analysis is fresh, provocative and absolutely gripping. For all struggling to live as thinking people in the Age of Terror, he has written an essential text." --Mark Danner, author of <em>The Massacre at El Mozote: A Parable of the Cold War</em><p></p><br>"I have several disagreements with Robin's learned book, but it is so brilliantly provocative that it should be widely read and debated."--John Patrick Diggins, Distinguished Professor of History, The Graduate Center, City University of New York<p></p><br>"In this timely and provocative work, Corey Robin provides an acute and sustained analysis of the very idea of fear, of the role of fear as an instrument of political rule and of its unacknowledged prevalence within our liberal democratic institutions. He makes a powerful case against those who defend a 'liberalism of fear' and contend that fear can be a source of moral and political regeneration." --Steven Lukes, Professor of Sociology, New York University<p></p><br>"A truly significant and highly original contribution to the understanding of the politics of fear, its consequences and ramifications, intended and unintended. What emerges is a complex picture of collaboration between various levels of government, civil society groups, manipulators and victims, governing elites and ordinary citizens, popular culture, management and workers. It provides, as no other work I know, a context for grappling with the post-9/11 world." --Sheldon S. Wolin, Professor of Politics Emeritus, Princeton University<p></p><br></p><h2>Heat and Thermodynamics: An Intermediate Textbook</h2><p>This respected text deals with large-scale, easily known thermal phenomena and then proceeds to small-scale, less accessible phenomena. The wide range of mathematics used in Dittman and Zemansky&#39;s text simultaneously challenges students who have completed a course in impartial differential calculus without alienating those students who have only taken a calculus-based general physics course. Examples of calculations are presented shortly after important formulas are derived. Students see the solutions of problems related to the formulas. Actual thermodynamic experiments are explained in detail. The student sees the applicability of abstract thermodynamic concepts and formulas to real situations.</p><p></p><h2>Autobiography of Mark Twain: Volume 1, Reader&#x2019;s Edition (Mark Twain Papers)</h2><p>The year 2010 marked the 100th anniversary of Mark Twain&#x2019;s death.

It is true but it doesn't give even a whiff of the grandeur of the thing."&#x2015;Robert D. Richardson, author of <i>Emerson: The Mind on Fire</i><br><br>"Mark Twain, always so blithely ahead of his time, has just outdone himself: he's brought us an Autobiography from beyond the grave: a hundred-year-old relic that yet manages to accomplish something new. It anticipates the Cubism just taking form in Samuel Clemens's last years, by exploding the confines of orderliness, sequence, the dutiful march of this-then-that. In so doing, it gives us not simply Mark Twain's life&#x2015;that is the prosaic work of biographers&#x2015;but the ways in which he thought of his life: in all the fragmented recollection, distraction, creation, revision and dreaming that make up the true, divinely jumbled devices we all use to recapture experience and feeling.

Both authors discuss Jerusalem's history, mixing in the romantic elements of art and the grandeur of architecture. Bahat combines text and art in a complementary fashion, focusing on the emotional and religious components of Jerusalem's historical development. He presents the romantic and religious views of Jerusalem held by three monotheistic religions and discusses how the art became a way to create a consciousness of the holy site for people far away. The art reflects visions of Jerusalem by both European and Islamic artists, though there are too few representations of Islamic art. Brooke's discussion covers sacred space, pilgrimage, and photographers in the 19th and 20th centuries. The photos, primarily of ruins, houses of worship, and buildings in sacred places, illustrate how buildings create and further a place's centrality for a people. Bahat and Brooke both succeed in demonstrating Jerusalem's presence in religious consciousness, showing how the city, its respective governments, and the three monotheistic religions have left their mark on one another. These books complement each other and can be enjoyed separately; both are recommended for public and academic libraries where there is interest in the subject.ANaomi E. Hafter, Broward Cty. P.L., Ft.

For Manuel DeLanda, however, this new weaponry has a significance that goes far beyond military applications; he shows how it represents a profound historical shift in the relation of human beings both to machines and to information. The recent emergence of intelligent and autonomous bombs and missiles equipped with artificial perception and decision-making capabilities is, for Delanda, part of a much larger transfer of cognitive structures from humans to machines in the late twentieth century.War in the Age of Intelligent Machines provides a rich panorama of these astonishing developments; it details the mutating history of information analysis and machinic organization from the mobile siege artillery of the Renaissance, the clockwork armies of the Thirty Years War, the Napoleonic campaigns, and the Nazi blitzkrieg up to present-day cybernetic battle-management systems and satellite reconnaissance networks. Much more than a history of warfare, DeLanda&#39;s account is an unprecedented philosophical and historical reflection on the changing forms through which human bodies and materials are combined, organized, deployed, and made effective.Manuel DeLanda has published essays on philosophy and film theory.

Noted landscape and architectural historian Marc Treib counters this prevailing view in an authoritative and unprecedented survey of 20th-century buildings and their landscapes. Exploring a range of architectural, philosophical, and theoretical approaches, Treib investigates the site strategies of five prominent modern-period architects: Frank Lloyd Wright (1867&#x2013;1959), Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (1886&#x2013;1969), Richard Neutra (1892&#x2013;1970), Alvar Aalto (1898&#x2013;1976), and Luis Barragï¿½n (1902&#x2013;1988).<br><br> The character of the sites on which these architects worked dramatically affected their architecture and gardens, a fact illustrated by Wright&#x2019;s &#x201c;organic&#x201d; regard of the desert; Mies&#x2019;s evolving divorce of building from terrain; Neutra&#x2019;s transformation of the &#x201c;realities&#x201d; of the site; Aalto&#x2019;s use of the forest metaphor and interior landscapes; and Barragï¿½n&#x2019;s architectonic conversion of the land. Fully illustrated with rarely published archival drawings and plans, accompanied by the author&#x2019;s own exceptional photographs, this book presents the spectrum of architectural responses to the constraints of site, climate, client, program, building material, region, and nation. Taken as a group, the work of these five architects sheds important light on the consideration and influence of the site and landscape on the practice of architecture during the 20th century.</p><p>This unprecedented study delves into the fascinating and significant ways in which modern architecture, landscape, and site strategy interrelate in the work of five prominent architects.<br><b>Marc Treib</b> is professor of architecture emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Linux Kernel Development</h2><p><p>The Linux kernel is one of the most important and far-reaching open-source projects.

I did not want to write simply yet another kernel book. Sure, there are not <i>that many</i> books on the subject, but I still wanted my approach to be somehow unique. What would place my book at the top of its subject? I was not motivated unless I could do something special, a best-in-class work.</p><p>I then realized that I could offer quite a unique approach to the topic. My job is hacking the kernel. My hobby is hacking the kernel. My<i> </i>love is hacking the kernel.<i> </i>Over the years, I have surely accumulated interesting anecdotes and important tips. With my experiences, I could write a book on how to hack the kernel and&#x2014;more importantly&#x2014;how <i>not</i> to hack the kernel. Primarily, this is a book about the design and implementation of the Linux kernel. The book's approach differs from would-be competition, however, in that the information is given with a slant to learning enough to actually get work done&#x2014;and getting it done right. I am a pragmatic guy and this is a practical book. It should be fun, easy to read, and useful.</p><p>I hope that readers can walk away from this book with a better understanding of the rules (written and unwritten) of the kernel. I hope readers, fresh from reading this book and the kernel source code, can jump in and start writing useful, correct, clean kernel code. Of course, you can read this book just for fun, too.</p><p>That was the first edition. Time has passed, and now we return once more to the fray. This edition offers quite a bit over the first: intense polish and revision, updates, and many fresh sections and all new chapters. Changes in the kernel since the first edition have been recognized. More importantly, however, is the decision made by the Linux kernel community1 to not proceed with a 2.7 development kernel in the near feature. Instead, kernel developers plan to continue developing and stabilizing 2.6. This implies many things, but one big item of relevance to this book is that there is quite a bit of staying power in a recent book on the 2.6 Linux kernel. If things do not move too quickly, there is a greater chance of a captured snapshot of the kernel remaining relevant long into the future. A book can finally rise up and become the canonical documentation for the kernel. I hope that you are holding that book.</p><p>Anyhow, here it is. I hope you enjoy it.</p><p><b>So Here We Are</b></p><p>Developing code in the kernel does not require genius, magic, or a bushy Unix-hacker beard. The kernel, although having some interesting rules of its own, is not much different from any other large software endeavor. There is much to learn&#x2014;as with any big project&#x2014;but there is not too much about the kernel that is more sacred or confusing than anything else.</p><p>It is imperative that you utilize the source. The open availability of the source code for the Linux system is a rarity that we must not take for granted. It is not sufficient <i>only</i> to read the source, however. You need to dig in and change some code. Find a bug and fix it. Improve the drivers for your hardware. Find an itch and scratch it! Only when you <i>write</i> code will it all come together.</p><p><b>Kernel Version</b></p><p>This book is based on the 2.6 Linux kernel series. Specifically, it is up to date as of Linux kernel version 2.6.10. The kernel is a moving target and no book can hope to capture a dynamic beast in a timeless manner. Nonetheless, the basics and core internals of the kernel are mature and I work hard to present the material with an eye to the future and with as wide applicability as possible.</p><p><b>Audience</b></p><p>This book targets software developers who are interested in understanding the Linux kernel. It is <i>not</i> a line-by-line commentary of the kernel source. Nor is it a guide to developing drivers or a reference on the kernel API (as if there even were a formal kernel API&#x2014;hah!). Instead, the goal of this book is to provide enough information on the design and implementation of the Linux kernel that a sufficiently accomplished programmer can begin developing code in the kernel. Kernel development can be fun and rewarding, and I want to introduce the reader to that world as readily as possible. This book, however, in discussing both theory and application, should appeal to readers of either interest. I have always been of the mind that one needs to understand the theory to understand the application, but I do not feel that this book leans too far in either direction. I hope that whatever your motivations for understanding the Linux kernel, this book will explain the design and implementation sufficiently for your needs.</p><p>Thus, this book covers both the usage of core kernel systems and their design and implementation. I think this is important, and deserves a moment's discussion. A good example is Chapter 7, "Bottom Halves and Deferring Work," which covers bottom halves. In that chapter, I discuss both the design and implementation of the kernel's bottom-half mechanisms (which a core kernel developer might find interesting) and how to actually use the exported interfaces to implement your own bottom half (which a device driver developer might find interesting). In fact, I believe both parties should find both discussions relevant. The core kernel developer, who certainly needs to understand the inner workings of the kernel, should have a good understanding of how the interfaces are actually used. At the same time, a device driver writer will benefit from a good understanding of the implementation behind the interface.</p><p>This is akin to learning some library's API versus studying the actual implementation of the library. At first glance, an application programmer needs only to understand the API&#x2014;it is often taught to treat interfaces as a black box, in fact. Likewise, a library developer is concerned only with the library's design and implementation. I believe, however, both parties should invest time in learning the other half. An application programmer who better understands the underlying operating system can make much greater use of it. Similarly, the library developer should not grow out of touch with the reality and practicality of the applications that use the library. Consequently, I discuss both the design and usage of kernel subsystems, not only in hopes that this book will be useful to either party, but also in hopes that the <i>whole</i> book is useful to both parties.</p><p>I assume that the reader knows the C programming language and is familiar with Linux. Some experience with operating system design and related computer science concepts is beneficial, but I try to explain concepts as much as possible&#x2014;if not, there are some excellent books on operating system design referenced in the bibliography.</p><p>This book is appropriate for an undergraduate course introducing operating system design as the <i>applied </i>text if an introductory book on theory accompanies it. It should fare well either in an advanced undergraduate course or in a graduate-level course without ancillary material. I encourage potential instructors to contact me; I am eager to help.</p><p><b>Book Website</b></p><p>I maintain a website at http://tech9.net/rml/kernel_book/ that contains information pertaining to the book, including errata, expanded and revised topics, and information on future printings and editions. I encourage readers to check it out. I also apologize profusely for the previous end-of-sentence preposition, it was uncalled for, but the revamped sentence was hard to read, it was confusing, and <i>you deserve better</i>.</p><p><b>Second Edition Acknowledgments</b></p><p>Like most authors, I did not write this book in a cave (which is a good thing, because there are bears in caves) and consequently many hearts and minds contributed to the completion of this manuscript.

Problems are presented as signs, symptoms and laboratory abnormalities to simulate the way in which a veterinarian works toward a diagnosis. Each algorithm presumes that the first test performed has been a thorough history and physical examination, and from this point it relies on the use of clinical examination and diagnostic texts to progressively narrow a larger list of diagnoses for any given problem.

Since then <i>Flatland</i> has fascinated generations of readers, becoming a perennial science-fiction favorite. By imagining the contact of beings from different dimensions, the author fully exploited the power of the analogy between the limitations of humans and those of his two-dimensional characters.</p><br> <p> A first-rate fictional guide to the concept of multiple dimensions of space, the book will also appeal to those who are interested in computer graphics. This field, which literally makes higher dimensions seeable, has aroused a new interest in visualization. We can now manipulate objects in four dimensions and observe their three-dimensional slices tumbling on the computer screen. But how do we interpret these images? In his introduction, Thomas Banchoff points out that there is no better way to begin exploring the problem of understanding higher-dimensional slicing phenomena than reading this classic novel of the Victorian era.</p></p><p><i>Flatland</i> is one of the very few novels about math and philosophy that can appeal to almost any layperson. Published in 1880, this short fantasy takes us to a completely flat world of two physical dimensions where all the inhabitants are geometric shapes, and who think the planar world of length and width that they know is all there is. But one inhabitant discovers the existence of a third physical dimension, enabling him to finally grasp the concept of a fourth dimension. Watching our Flatland narrator, we begin to get an idea of the limitations of our own assumptions about reality, and we start to learn how to think about the confusing problem of higher dimensions. The book is also quite a funny satire on society and class distinctions of Victorian England.<p> <em>Flatland</em> (1884) is an influential mathematical fantasy that simultaneously provides an introduction to non-Euclidean geometry and a satire on the Victorian class structure, issues of science and faith, and the role of women. A classic of early science fiction, the novel takes place in a world of two dimensions where all the characters are geometric shapes. The narrator, A Square, is a naï¿½ve, respectable citizen who is faced with proof of the existence of three dimensions when he is visited by a sphere and is forced to see the limitations of his world. </p> <p> The introduction to this Broadview Edition provides context for the book&#x2019;s references to Victorian culture and religion, mathematical history, and the history of philosophy. The appendices contain contemporary reviews; extracts from the work of fellow mathematical fantasy writer/mathematician Charles Hinton; Hermann von Helmboltz&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Axioms of Geometry&#x201d; (1870); and autobiographical passages from Abbott&#x2019;s <em>The Kernel and the Husk</em> (1886). </p></p><h2>Precedents in Architecture, 2E</h2><p>Precedents in Architecture provides a vocabulary for architectural analysis that will help you understand the works of others, and aid you in creating your own designs.

Yet ever since <em>Roe v. Wade</em> was decided in 1973, anti-abortion forces have tried nearly every tactic to eliminate it. Legislative and judicial developments dominate the news, but a troubling and all-too-common phenomenon-targeted vigilante action against individual abortion providers-is missing from the national discussion, only cropping up when a dramatic story like the murder of an abortion provider pushes it to the forefront. Every day, men and women who are associated with abortion care are harassed, threatened, stalked, picketed, sent hate mail, and otherwise terrorized. Those who seek help from the law are sometimes successful, but not always, either because there are insufficient protections built into the law, or because law enforcement officials fail to respond. <br><br>In <em>Living in the Crosshairs</em>, the voices of these providers are heard for the first time, through extensive interviews that David S. Cohen and Krysten Connon conducted across the country. Abortion providers are targeted at home, at work, or in community spaces; they can be harassed in person or online. Abortion opponents target not only the providers themselves but also may go after their families, neighbors, and others close to them. This kind of targeting happens anywhere in the country, not just in more conservative areas, and can victimize all providers, not just high-profile doctors. For some, being the victim of targeted harassment inspires significant fear and leads to changes in behavior; for others, it has become a normal part of life; and for yet others, it actively strengthens their resolve. The response of law enforcement at the federal, state, and local levels is spotty-though there are some strong laws on the books, especially at the federal level, abortion providers have had mixed experiences when it comes to legal recourse, and effectiveness varies. Drawing on ideas from the interviews, the authors propose several legal and societal reforms that could improve the lives of providers, foremost among them redefining targeted harassment as terrorism rather than protest. <br><br><em>Living in the Crosshairs</em> is a rich and humane portrait of women's health professionals who persist in their work despite harassment because they believe in what they are doing. These providers' voices have not been heard in recent debates, leaving the public with a deficient understanding of exactly how abortion is limited in this country, yet their experiences illuminate the truth of the issue and offer us a path to a better policy.<br></p><p><br><strong>David S. Cohen</strong> is a law professor at Drexel University Thomas R. Kline School of Law, where he teaches constitutional law and gender and the law. Prior to teaching, Cohen was a staff attorney at the Women's Law Project in Philadelphia and litigated cases involving abortion clinic safety, reproductive rights, Title IX, and LGBT family law.<br><br><strong>Krysten Connon</strong> is a 2012 graduate of the Drexel University School of Law. Following law school, Connon worked as a federal judicial law clerk. She is currently an attorney in private practice in Philadelphia.<br><br>"It's all too easy for Americans to imagine that protest targeting abortion workers has died down in recent years. David Cohen and Krysten Connon's <em>Living in the Crosshairs</em> offers a bracing corrective to that misimpression, with this deep dive into the daily lives of abortion providers -- from bulletproof vests to online stalking. <em>Living in the Crosshairs</em> affords us a look at the legal framework that protects providers from such targeted harassment and imagines the reforms needed to do so more effectively. For anyone wondering why reproductive freedom is on the decline in America, this book moves the conversation from vague abstraction to the vitally concrete." -Dahlia Lithwick, Slate.com<p></p><br>"In this compelling and important book, Cohen and Connon show beyond a doubt that the harassment of abortion providers is ongoing, pervasive, serious -- and often unpunished. It's time to call it by its rightful name: terrorism." -Katha Pollitt, author of <em>Pro: Reclaiming Abortion Rights</em><p></p><br>"Cohen and Connon have written a terrific, though chilling book describing how abortion providers are harassed and terrorized. Relying on in-depth interviews, they offer an unprecedented description of what those who provide reproductive health services must endure. Their proposals for legal reform should be an agenda for action and legislatures across the country." -Erwin Chemerinsky, founding Dean and Distinguished Professor of Law, and Raymond Pryke Professor of First Amendment Law, the University of California, Irvine School of Law<p></p><br>"<em>Living in the Crosshairs</em> is an extremely important addition to the literature on abortion in the United States. For those readers unfamiliar with the day-to-day realities of abortion provision, this book will be a true eye-opener, as the authors detail the unacceptable, often harrowing, situations that abortion providers have long endured at the hands of their opponents, and continue to do so to this day. Most valuably, the book outlines the necessary legal and social reforms to address this violence and terrorism. A must-read for those who care about the future of abortion availability in this country." -Carole Joffe, Professor, Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health, University of California, San Francisco; author, <em>Dispatches from the Abortion Wars: The Costs of Fanaticism to Doctors, Patients, and the Rest of Us</em><p></p><br>"<em>Living in the Crosshairs</em> gives statistics a human face often missing in media coverage as it details the real, day-to-day experiences of abortion providers in this country. In addition to bringing to light stories of harassment, <em>Crosshairs</em> also calls for reforms in the legal system, making it an absolute must-read for anyone in media and/or reproductive rights advocacy." -<em>RH Reality Check</em><p></p><br>"...a gripping, well-researched and maddening book, and while it is not the first or only text to highlight the abuse foisted on providers, it offers a clear list of common-sense recommendations for improving staff and patient safety." -<em>Truthout</em><p></p><br>"<em>Living in the Crosshairs</em> exposes the harrowing reality facing abortion providers in the U.S. Law professor David Cohen and attorney Krysten Connon vividly illustrate the impact of this nationwide campaign of terror on its victims. They examine the many inadequacies of law enforcement's current response to harassment of abortion providers, calling for additional responses from local law enforcement and extensively discussing the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act." -<em>Ms. Magazine</em><p></p><br>"We are all guaranteed equal protection under the law, except for health care workers, administrators, and volunteers, as revealed in <em>Living in the Crosshairs</em>. Strong stomachs are required to read this book because the anti-abortion terrorists kidnap the children of clinic workers, assault them at their homes, and have committed murder. All persons not wishing to treat women as biblical chattel ought to read this book." -<em>New York Journal of Books</em><p></p><br>"If, like many Americans, you thought the intensity of antiabortion activism had declined since the bad old days of mass clinic sit-ins and killings of doctors, read <em>Living in the Crosshairs</em> and think again." -<em>Council for Secular Humanism</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Gothic Architecture (The Yale University Press Pelican History of Art)</h2><p>This magisterial study of Gothic architecture traces the meaning and development of the Gothic style through medieval churches across Europe.

Corn's long-awaited new book proposes a remarkable revisioning of the history of American modern art between the two world wars. Moving away from issues of style and abstraction, she bases her work on a broad examination of culture and on discourses of national identity. Corn argues that the key questions for interwar modernists in New York and Paris were whether or not it was possible to create an art that was both American and modern, and if it was, what such an art would look like. Both European and American artists debated these questions and made art that responded to them.<br><br>Corn organizes each chapter around a careful reading of a work of art, probing first its peculiar poetry and style and then its connection to its artist and the cultural influences surrounding it. The result is an unfolding of the work's contingent relationships with history, literature, art criticism, music, and popular culture. The works she examines&#x2014;from those made by the Stieglitz circle to those by European Dadaists&#x2014;were part of the quest for "the Great American Thing," a quest that was international in scope and that inspired a decade of vibrant cultural exchange between the art capitals of Europe and New York.<br><br>Passionate and eminently readable, with more than 300 illustrations&#x2014;drawings, paintings, sculptures, advertisements, cartoons, and documentary photographs&#x2014;<i>The Great American Thing</i> indelibly alters the way we think about the first decades of American modernism and the legacy it created.</p><p>"Wanda Corn's work is a triumph, and will be a welcome and provocative addition to the literature of modernism.

He explains how the chakra system connects to both mind and body to form a body/mind interface, allowing us to read the physical body as a mirror of the consciousness within, track the route from symptom to cause, and then work on releasing the causes on all levels. <br><br>Brofman shows how specific tensions or symptoms on the physical level reflect corresponding tensions in one&#x2019;s consciousness about specific issues in life--the inner cause to the outer symptom. The author explains how healing the symptom needs to involve not only releasing the tension on the physical level, but also letting go of the stressful way of interacting with the environment. Thus, the process of healing always implies a process of transformation. <br><br>Within the concepts of his Body Mirror System, Brofman explores the chakras and their role in the body, including their associated vibrations, parts of the body, senses, layers of the aura, and areas of consciousness. He explains how to clear and connect the chakras, how to connect to the cosmos through the chakras, and how engaging with thought forms, time travel, and past lives can assist in healing sessions. Discussing the healing of others as well as self-healing, Brofman describes how to heal with chakras, thought forms, white light, and love, and how to perform distance healing. He provides practical energy exercises and chakra meditations, allowing the reader to imminently experience the healing energy in their bodies and prepare for a healing session. He also includes color reference guides, such as a chakra healing chart. <br><br>Deeply examining the multilayered elements of the healing process, including transformation, this classic healing guide serves as a practical introduction to energy healing as well as a healer&#x2019;s tutorial and reference book.</p><p>MARTIN BROFMAN (1940-2014), renowned healer and founder of the Brofman Foundation for the Advancement of Healing, created a special healing approach, the Body Mirror System, after he cured himself of a terminal illness in 1975.

In January 2000, leaders of the Society for Conservation Biology convened a similar group to reach consensus on where the field now stands and to determine the major, compelling research priorities for the next decade. Conservation Biology: Research Priorities for the Next Decade presents the results of that gathering.</p><p>The book: </p><ul><li>notes progress or changes in the state of global biodiversity over the past decade and discusses overarching themes that influence all areas of conservation </li><li>offers ten chapters by leading experts that summarize the status of knowledge in key areas ranging from marine conservation to ecological restoration to conservation medicine </li><li>sets forth research priorities for each area </li><li>describes gaps in current knowledge that are impeding the ability of conservation practitioners to carry out their work</li></ul><p>A final synthesis chapter brings together cross-cutting themes that integrate the diverse topics within the context of global biodiversity loss, and presents a call to action for scientists and others working in the field.</p><p>Conservation Biology: Research Priorities for the Next Decade represents an indispensable guide to the research that is most urgently needed to support effective conservation, and will be must reading for anyone involved with the field of conservation biology.</p></p><p></p><h2>Odes: With the Latin Text (Modern Library Classics)</h2><p>Timeless meditations on the subjects of wine, parties, birthdays, love, and friendship, Horace&#x2019;s <i>Odes</i>, in the words of classicist Donald Carne-Ross, make the &#x201c;commonplace notable, even luminous.&#x201d; This edition reproduces the highly lauded translation by James Michie. &#x201c;For almost forty years,&#x201d; poet and literary critic John Hollander notes, &#x201c;James Michie&#x2019;s brilliant translations of Horace have remained fresh as well as strong, and responsive to the varying lights and darks of the originals.

Ancient Egypt: A Social History, first published in 1983, presents an innovative perspective on the ancient societies which flourished in the Nile Valley from the Predynastic period to the conquest by Alexander the Great. From the introduction of a subsistence economy through the establishment of the first agricultural communities to the development of urban centres and the political state, this volume traces the process of political, social and economic change. The emphasis on the social and economic aspects of Egyptian society and the integration of archaeological and historical data mark a new departure in Egyptian studies.</p><p>The processes of political, social and economic change are traced in an original survey of the ancient societies that flourished in the Nile Valley from the predynastic period to the conquest by Alexander the Great.'[The book] provides an excellent treatment of Egyptian history for the period before it was absorbed into the Graeco-Roman world.'

In this innovative study, Mark Cioc focuses on the river from the moment when the Congress of Vienna established a multinational commission charged with making the river more efficient for purposes of trade and commerce in 1815. He examines the engineering and administrative decisions of the next century and a half that resulted in rapid industrial growth as well as profound environmental degradation, and highlights the partially successful restoration efforts undertaken from the 1970s to the present. <p>The Rhine is a classic example of a 'multipurpose' river -- used simultaneously for transportation, for industry and agriculture, for urban drinking and sanitation needs, for hydroelectric production, and for recreation. It thus invites comparison with similarly over-burdened rivers such as the Mississippi, Hudson, Colorado, and Columbia. The Rhineï¿½s environmental problems are, however, even greater than those of other rivers because it is so densely populated (50 million people live along its borders), so highly industrialized (10% of global chemical production), and so short (775 miles in length). </p><p>Two centuries of nonstop hydraulic tinkering have resulted in a Rhine with a sleek and slender profile. In their quest for a perfect canal-like river, engineers have modified it more than any other large river in the world. As a consequence, between 1815 and 1975, the river lost most of its natural floodplain, riverside vegetation, migratory fish, and biodiversity. Recent efforts to restore that biodiversity, though heartening, can have only limited success because so many of the structural changes to the river are irreversible. </p><p>The Rhine: An Eco-Biography, 1815-2000 makes clear just how central the river has been to all aspects of European political, economic, and environmental life for the past two hundred years. </p><p>"The Rhine: An Eco-Biography is the first true environmental history of a major European river. The story Mark Cioc tells in these pages is both fascinating and cautionary. What happened to the Rhine during the 19th and 20th centuries was unquestionably one of the success stories of modern history, a triumphant example of the human benefits that can flow from harnessing natureï¿½s power to benefit humanity. But an immense price was paid for those benefits, so much so that by the closing decades of the 20th century, enormous efforts were being expended to recover some of the creatures, ecosystems, and natural processes that had once been sacrificed to the dream of progress." -- from the Foreword by William Cronon</p></p><p><p>An innovative study of the history of the <i>Rhine</i> River and its modification to suit the needs of industrialization</p>Mark Cioc is professor of history at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He is the author of Pax Atomica: The Nuclear Defense Debate in West Germany during the Adenauer Era.</p><h2>The Biblical Basis for Modern Science</h2><p>For decades, Henry Morris has been known as a defender of the Christian faith. Itï¿½&#x20ac;&#x2122;s an auspicious title for such a humble man, yet no one can deny that the grasp Morris has on science and faith issues is staggering.<br><br>In this updated classic, Morris walks the reader through historyï¿½&#x20ac;&#x201d;real historyï¿½&#x20ac;&#x201d;by showing the absurdity of evolution. From a wide variety of sciences, including astronomy, biology, chemistry, physics, and geology, Morris presents clear evidence that the Bible gives us an astonishingly accurate record of the past, present, and future.<br><br></p><p></p><h2>Pride and Prejudice: Access Editions (The EMC Masterpiece Series)</h2><p>One of the greatest love stories ever told, beautifully repackaged for a modern teen audience Loved TWILIGHT?Then you&#39;ll adore Pride and Prejudice! Love isn&#39;t always at first sight. When Elizabeth Bennet meets Mr Darcy, it&#39;s fair to say he doesn&#39;t make the best first impression. Arrogant, condescending and aloof, he is everything the spirited and clever Elizbeth despises - and that&#39;s before he breaks her sister&#39;s heart. But why, then, do her thoughts turn to him again and again? Slowly, Elizabeth starts to realise that her first impression may have been wrong. But by then, it might just be too late!</p><p><i>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</i><p> Next to the exhortation at the beginning of <i>Moby-Dick</i>, "Call me Ishmael," the first sentence of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> must be among the most quoted in literature. And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print". Readers of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> would be hard-pressed to disagree. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

(Classroom Resource Material)</h2><p>Topology is a branch of mathematics packed with intriguing concepts, fascinating geometrical objects, and ingenious methods for studying them. The authors have written this textbook to make the material accessible to undergraduate students without requiring extensive prerequisites in upper-level mathematics. The approach is to cultivate the intuitive ideas of continuity, convergence, and connectedness so students can quickly delve into knot theory, the topology of surfaces and three-dimensional manifolds, fixed points and elementary homotopy theory. The fundamental concepts of point-set topology appear at the end of the book when students can see how this level of abstraction provides a sound logical basis for the geometrical ideas that have come before. This organization exposes students to the exciting world of topology now(!) rather than later. Students using this textbook should have some exposure to the geometry of objects in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces together with an appreciation of precise mathematical definitions and proofs.</p><p>Topology is a branch of mathematics packed with intriguing concepts, fascinating geometrical objects, and ingenious methods for studying them.

With <i>Anti-Inflammatory Eating Made Easy</i>, eat as much as you want, lose weight, and heal your body. More and more people have become aware of the many benefits of an anti-inflammatory diet. Seattle nutritionist Michelle Babb has created an easy-to-follow nutrition plan and cookbook that helps readers combat inflammation with healthy recipes and food choices. Making dramatic lifestyle changes can be difficult, but the seventy-five recipes and nutrition plan in this book make that change approachable, understandable, sustainable, and delicious. Adopting an anti-inflammatory diet can help alleviate arthritis, type 2 diabetes, food allergies, skin conditions, weight gain, and many other symptoms of chronic inflammation.</p><p>MICHELLE BABB, MS, RD, CD, is a registered dietitian specializing in mind-body nutrition, weight management, and inflammatory digestive disorders. She is also PCC Cooks instructor who teaches classes about the anti-inflammatory diet. She holds a Master&#39;s degree in nutrition from Bastyr University and has also trained at the Center for Mind Body Medicine. When she&#39;s not in the kitchen, Michelle enjoys running, kayaking, sailing, and traveling. She lives in Seattle,WA.Many people swear by an "anti-inflammatory" diet to help ease everything from joint pain to cancer. In many ways, it strongly resembles a Mediterranean diet, focusing primarily on plants, with protein coming from legumes, nuts, and fish. In her first cookbook, Babb provides a brief introduction to this type of eating and also a plan for a 21-day cleanse. The vast majority of the book though is a basic cookbook, with 75 delicious-sounding recipes. Nicely illustrated with beautiful color photos, the recipes include all the usual categories (breakfast, salads, sides, vegetarian entrees) but also some you might not expect, including fish and meat entrees, snacks, and desserts. While some ingredients may not be in your pantry (chia seeds, agave nectar), the recipes themselves are generally uncomplicated and mainstream enough to please most palates.&nbsp;Verdict:&nbsp;A nice addition to the cookbook shelf, with recipes that will appeal to many, not just those with specific health concerns.

As Collett describes it, he is aiming his writing at an intermediate level. This book is quite well written and straightforward to follow, but does require some statistics background of the reader...this book is definitely worth a look for anyone who teaches or conducts survival analyses.

For the past 75 years, ART THROUGH THE AGES has defined the introductory art history course. The intention of this classic, in Helen Gardner&#39;s words, has been &#34;to introduce the reader to certain phases of art, architecture, painting, sculpture, and the minor arts from the remote days of the glacial age in Europe, through successive civilizations of the Near East, Europe, America, and the Orient, to the twentieth century.&#34; Now, as we begin a new millennium, we do so with the eleventh edition.

Before the largest companies moved beyond national boundaries, they crossed state lines, abandoning the industrial centers of the Eastern Seaboard for impoverished rural communities in the Midwest and South. In their wake they left the decaying urban landscapes and unemployment rates that became hallmarks of late twentieth-century America. This is the story that Jefferson Cowie, in &#x201c;a stunningly important work of historical imagination and rediscovery&#x201d; (Nelson Lichtenstein), tells through the lens of a single American corporation, RCA.</p><p><i>Capital Moves</i> takes us through the interconnected histories of Camden, New Jersey; Bloomington, Indiana; Memphis, Tennessee; and Juï¿½rez, Mexico&#x2014;four cities radically transformed by America&#x2019;s leading manufacturer of records and radio sets. In a sweeping narrative of economic upheaval and class conflict, Cowie weaves together the rich detail of local history with the national&#x2014;and ultimately international&#x2014;story of economic and social change.</p></p><p>Jefferson Cowie is a professor of labor history and the chair of the department of labor relations, law, and history at Cornell University. He is the author of <i>Capital Moves: RCA&#x2019;s Seventy-Year Quest for Cheap Labor</i> (The New Press), which received the 2000 Philip Taft Prize for the Best Book in Labor History, and of <i>Stayin&#x2019; Alive: The 1970s and the Last Days of the Working Class</i> (The New Press), which received the Francis Parkman Prize for the Best Book in American History from the Society of American Historians and the Merle Curti Award from the Organization of American Historians. He lives in Ithaca, New York.Much has been written to document and lament the loss of American jobs to cheap labor abroad. Cowie's study of RCA, though, shows that U.S. companies have a long history of seeking out inexpensive labor. Before moving to Juarez, Mexico, in the 1970s, RCA had already moved its television manufacturing operations twice within the U.S. Cowie traces RCA's journey from Camden, New Jersey, to Mexico. After its manufacturing facilities were successfully unionized in the 1930s, RCA decided to decentralize operations and relocated a major factory to nonunion southern Indiana in 1940. In the 1960s, the company experimented with expansion into the South, but operations in Memphis were shut down within five years. Cowie shows how the same factors that determined RCA's first two moves were the same ones that influenced the move to Mexico. He does not focus, however, on the painful economic consequences of plant closures. In spite of the shutdowns, he shows that wherever RCA opened a new plant, each community was permanently transformed by the economic empowerment of its workforce. <i>David Rouse</i></p><h2>Atlas of the Irish rural landscape (Irish Cultural Studies)</h2><p><p>Lush and green, the beauty of Ireland's landscape is legendary.

Combining his own 30 years of research with practical insight from the many phototherapy pioneers he&#x2019;s encountered, the author examines scientific studies on how specific wavelengths of light influence our cells and DNA, brain function, sleep patterns, and emotional stability; speed the healing of wounds; and are effective in the treatment of disease, including arthritis, stroke, Alzheimer&#x2019;s, Parkinson&#x2019;s, and brain and nerve injuries. Exploring the spiritual aspects of light, the author explains why auras and halos have been used to represent sages and saints of all traditions, revealing the intimate link between light and consciousness. <br><br>Investigating the many laser, monochrome, audiovisual, and infrared machines designed to heal disease and treat emotional disorders, Martel also reveals promising medical applications for light that are currently in development, inviting the reader not only to appreciate the complexities of light but to maximize its therapeutic dimensions.</p><p>Anadi Martel is a physicist and electronics designer, who has acted as a consultant for IMAX, Cirque du Soleil, and the Metropolitan Opera of New York. For more than 30 years he has researched the therapeutic properties of light and the interaction between technology and consciousness, leading to the creation of the Sensora multisensorial system. His sound spatialization devices have been used around the world, including by NASA. He serves as President of the International Light Association (ILA) and lives in Quebec.<b>Chapter 5 <br><br>Light Medicine <br><br>The History and Uses of Phototherapy</b> <br><br><i>We are still on the threshold of fully understanding the complex relationship between light and life, but we can now say emphatically, that the function of our entire metabolism is dependent on light.</i> <br>--Fritz Albert Popp <br><br>Inspired by the discoveries of the biological pathways of light described in the previous chapter, light medicine (often called <i>phototherapy</i>) has been in full expansion since the beginning of the 21st century. <br><br>There are two main categories of phototherapy: <br><br>ï¿½ First there is the type that makes use of the natural interactions that light already has with our bodies: <i>endogenous phototherapy</i>. It includes therapies based on photobiomodulation (the interaction of light and cell mitochondria) and chronobiology (the interaction of light and circadian rhythms). Endogenous phototherapy usually has regenerative properties and tends to reestablish natural order in a non-invasive way. <br><br>ï¿½ Then there are therapies that use light as a catalyst in custom-made biological processes: <i>synthetic phototherapy</i>. They arise from our increasing understanding of the biochemistry of chromophores, those molecules capable of absorbing or emitting light, enabling us to make use of them in completely new ways. These therapies are generally more invasive and radical and are used for more aggressive interventions: for example <i>dynamic phototherapy</i> excels in the destruction of cancer cells, and ultraviolet phototherapy can heal certain infections and serious diseases through the sterilization of pathogens. <br><br><b>The Tools of Light Medicine</b> <br><br><b><i>Lasers</i> <br></b><br>Lasers generate light with very precise wavelengths and almost no divergence, allowing for a very fine and intense focal point. Several types of medical lasers are now in use including: <br><br>ï¿½ Ablative lasers: often in the infrared range and very powerful, they can vaporize layers of the epidermis and are used in dermatology. Other types emit green light to vaporise vascularized tissue (since red blood best absorbs green light), used for tumour excision. <br><br>ï¿½ Fractional lasers: their rays are fractured into tiny micro-beams making it possible to treat skin without harm. Used in aesthetic dermatology. <br><br>ï¿½ Pulsed lasers: emit light in very intense but very short bursts in the range of a nanosecond (10-9 s) to a femtosecond (10-15 s). They are used as scalpels in surgery. <br><br>ï¿½ Excimer (or exiplex) lasers: produce ultraviolet light and are used in the treatment of psoriasis and vitiligo. <br><br>ï¿½ Laser diodes: low intensity semiconductor lasers that are more compact and economical than other types of lasers. Used for photobiomodulation to reach specific spots in deep tissue. <br><br><b><i>Intense Pulsed Light (IPL)</i></b> <br><br>Flashing lamps, fitted with coloured filters and emitting several powerful pulses per second, are increasingly used in dermatology and aesthetic medicine. The best ones have an integrated cooling system to improve comfort. <br><br><b><i>LEDs</i></b> <br><br>These can replace lasers in certain applications, particularly in photobiomodulation. Medical LEDs come in a wide variety of strengths and optical beam widths. Different colours are used for different purposes: infrared and red for photobiomodulation, amber for aesthetics, green and blue for acne and chronobiology, ultraviolet in dentistry and for sterilization. <br><br><i><b>Fluorescent lamps </b></i><br><br>These are mostly used in the treatment of depression and in other chronobiological applications. <br><br><i><b>Photobiomodulation Therapy <br></b></i><br>Photobiomodulation intervenes at the very source of the cell's regenerative abilities. All ancient peoples, as well as the light therapy pioneers of the last century, used it intuitively. But it was not until the invention of the laser in the 1960s that its use in medicine first began, followed by a surge in its popularity as a result of the discoveries of Professor Tiina Karu in the 1990s. <br><br>Given the fundamental nature of the cellular processes involved in photobiomodulation, it is not surprising that the scope of possible applications keeps expanding. These applications include: <br><br>ï¿½ Repair and regeneration of tissues by the bio-stimulation of cellular metabolism (for wounds, muscle trauma, hair loss, macular degeneration, regeneration of internal organs such as the heart, liver and kidneys) <br><br>ï¿½ Stimulation of the immune system resulting in a lowering of inflammation (for dermatitis, eczema, asthma, arthritis) Pain relief (for post-operative pain, dental treatments, mucositis) <br><br>ï¿½ Neurological effects, both physiological and cognitive (for brain trauma, strokes, depression, memory problems, dementia) <br><br><b>A Well-Kept Secret?</b> <br><br>Photobiomodulation is already being applied by many specialists. High performance athletes (for example in the <i>Tour de France</i>) and the military have utilized it for several years now to treat muscle trauma or tendinitis, and astronauts have been using it longer still. Why then, apart from a few exceptions in sports medicine, would photobiomodulation not be more prevalent? <br><br>This can be partly explained by the fact that many of the applications of photobiomodulation are still experimental. Even if numerous clinical studies have shown convincing results, protocols still need to be established and the necessary clinical experience acquired before it can be put to general use. <br><br>It will therefore probably take a few more years before the remarkable treatments of photobiomodulation become readily available for all. Even after purely technical issues have been resolved, inertia in the medical system delays the practice of treatments that are radically different from those in common use. <br><br>The implementation of photobiomodulation varies greatly from one country to another. Russia is often at the forefront in this field. There phototherapy treatments are relatively common, including innovative applications such as those used for the prevention of heart problems (angina, cardiac arrest, and others). <br><br>In the U.S. some devices have already met the strict rules of the <i>Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</i> The first one, in 2002, was designed to treat carpal tunnel syndrome. In 2008 the World Health Organization endorsed photobiomodulation for the treatment of cervical pain. And in 2010 the <i>American Physical Therapy Association</i> recommended it for the treatment of injuries to the Achilles tendon. <br><br>Slowly but surely, photobiomodulation is being integrated into our health habits.</p><h2>Egon Schiele - Jenny Saville (German Edition)</h2><p>The main body of work by painter Egon Schiele (1890&#x2013;1918), who died at an early age, was produced within barely a decade. His famous nudes unwaverï¿½ingly probed the existential core of human experiï¿½ence. The paintings of Jenny Saville (* 1970 in Camï¿½bridge) are no less intense in terms of their physicality and confrontational stance. This catalogue brings toï¿½gether the works of these two artists for the first time. Revealed is the stylistic and thematic proximity of the body-landscapes and portraits by the two young &#x201c;stars&#x201d;&#x2015;despite the decades separating their work and their varying use of the brush. The paintï¿½ings and drawings of both artists lend the human body an insistent corporeality, which is rendered in every detail. In Schiele&#x2019;s self-portraits, usually small-format works, the pose, the accentuated view from below, and gestural style give the images a visual impact equal to the forceful punch of Saville&#x2019;s giant formats.

P. Snow once remarked that not knowing the second law of thermodynamics is like never having read Shakespeare. Yet, while many people grasp the first law of energy, "Energy can neither be created nor destroyed," few recognize the second, "Entropy can only increase." What is entropy anyway, and why must it increase? Whether we want to know how a device as simple as a refrigerator works or understand the fate of the universe, we must start with the concepts of energy and entropy. In <i>The Refrigerator and the Universe</i>, Martin and Inge Goldstein explain the laws of thermodynamics for science buffs and neophytes alike. They begin with a lively presentation of the historical development of thermodynamics. The authors then show how the laws follow from the atomic theory of matter and give examples of their applicability to such diverse phenomena as the radiation of light from hot bodies, the formation of diamonds from graphite, how the blood carries oxygen, and the history of the earth. The laws of energy, the Goldsteins conclude, have something to say about everything, even if they do not tell us everything about anything. </p><p> In <i>The Refrigerator and the Universe</i>, Martin and Inge Goldstein explain the laws of thermodynamics for science buffs and neophytes alike.

A landmark of American cuisine first published in 1898 as <i>El cocinero espaï¿½ol (The Spanish Cook), Encarnaciï¿½n's Kitchen </i>is the first cookbook written by a Hispanic in the United States, as well as the first recording of Californio food&#x2015;Mexican cuisine prepared by the Spanish-speaking peoples born in California. Pinedo's cookbook offers a fascinating look into the kitchens of a long-ago culture that continues to exert its influence today. <br><br>Of some three hundred of Pinedo's recipes included here&#x2015;a mixture of Basque, Spanish, and Mexican&#x2015;many are variations on traditional dishes, such as chilaquiles, chiles rellenos, and salsa (for which the cook provides fifteen versions). Whether describing how to prepare cod or ham and eggs (a typical Anglo dish labeled <i>"huevos hipï¿½critas"</i>), Pinedo was imparting invaluable lessons in culinary history and Latino culture along with her piquant directions. In addition to his lively, clear translation, Dan Strehl offers a remarkable view of Pinedo's family history and of the material and literary culture of early California cooking. Prize-winning journalist Victor Valle puts Pinedo's work into the context of Hispanic women's <i>testimonios </i>of the nineteenth century, explaining how the book is a deliberate act of cultural transmission from a traditionally voiceless group.</p><p>"It's a rare cookbook that is as pleasurable to think about as it is to cook from. But that's what Dan Strehl has accomplished with his elegant translation of <i>Encarnaciï¿½n&#x2019;s Kitchen,</i> a book that provides a fascinating look at the life and cooking of the wealthy Californios in the final days of the rich Rancho culture of California."&#x2015;Russ Parsons, author of <i>How to Read a French Fry</i><br><br>"At long last! It is with enormous pleasure that I greet Dan Strehl&#x2019;s authoritative English translation, <i>Encarnaciï¿½n&#x2019;s Kitchen.</i> I should like to have had the original Spanish edition as well, but I dream."&#x2015;Karen Hess, author of <i>The Carolina Rice Kitchen</i><br><br>"<i>Encarnaciï¿½n&#x2019;s Kitchen</i> is far more than a historical curiosity, or a mere kitchen fragment that sketches silhouettes of ingredients and techniques. The recipes of Encarnaciï¿½n Pinedo&#x2019;s kitchen, brought alive and set in context by Dan Strehl (and Victor Valle&#x2019;s lucid introduction), offer rich examples of how California&#x2019;s Mexican culinary culture developed as it bumped into&#x2015;and cross-pollinated with&#x2015;young, multifarious America. These dishes lay bare the often overlooked reality that food can be more than a reflection of culture.

Journeying through remote and beautiful lands, often in great peril, they collected the plants that shaped western garden design for 200 years. The stories are illustrated with portraits, photographs and maps. The book traces the journeys of 10 of the most significant plant hunters, from the 18th century to the last of the professionals, Frank Kingdon-Ward. It travels with Captain Cook and Sir Joseph Banks to South America, New Zealand and Australia. It treks over 9000 miles across North America with David Douglas, who laid claim to 200 species. It also explores California, South America and South East Asia with the Lobb brothers, and climbs into the Himalaya with Joseph Hooker in search of spectacular rhododendrons. It follows Robert Fortune, as he smuggles tea plants out of China, the foundation of a vast cash crop vital to the development of the Empire. These and other stories vividly bring to life the pioneering work of plant hunters.</p><p>Ever wonder how flowers from all over the world ended up in the same modern gardens? The plant hunters are the answer: Sir Joseph Banks, "the father of modern plant hunting," circled the globe with Captain Cook, bringing back rubescent evergreens from Tierra del Fuego and tall, "swordlike, leathery" New Zealand flax. From Kew Gardens in 18th-century London, Banks set up "a systematic, worldwide plant hunting program" that brought 7000 species of plants into habitats they would never have reached. Banks's prot g Francis Masson toted the belladona lily and the cycad from South Africa to London. Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker introduced rhododendrons from the Himalayas, thereby shaping British gardening throughout the 1860s. And George Forrest endured civil war and mountain hardships in his treks across Yunnan, China, bringing back for his pains the spectacular scarlet Primula and a star-shaped gentian with the deep blue tint of outer space. The authors devote a chapter to each of these men, and five other admiring chapters to other explorers, showing what each famous plant hunter underwent to bring prize flora to Britain, and what effect each hunter's discoveries had on British landscaping and gardening. In the spirit of the Victorian amateur, this book doesn't address such questions as whether these exciting exotics damaged the ecosystems to which plant hunters brought them, or what these finds contributed to fields other than landscape gardening. It offers, instead, stories of daring explorers alongside beautiful pictures of plants and of the spectacular landscapes from which these men fetched back the stems and flowers that gardeners love so well. 90 color, 15 b&amp;w illustrations. <p></p><p>Copyright 1999 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>KINGDOM HEARTS Chain of Memories Official Strategy Guide (Signature Series)</h2><p><p>BradyGames'&nbsp;<i>KINGDOM&nbsp;HEARTS&nbsp;Chain&nbsp;of&nbsp;Memories&nbsp;Official&nbsp;Strategy&nbsp;Guide</i>&nbsp;includes&nbsp;the&nbsp;following:</p> <ul> <li> Complete Walkthrough: Successfully battle through all 13 floors of Castle Oblivion! </li> <li> Complete Card Listing: Leave no card unturned!

It not only provides the proper orientation to its material, but its humanistic approach is more perceptive and illuminating than technical scholarship." &#x2015;Theodore H. Gaster, Columbia University</strong></p> This collection of writings is from authors who are either Indians who have tried to make themselves heard, or whites who have tried to hear Indians. The first part of the book emphasizes the practical and includes Isaac Tens's "Career of the Medicine Man". The second section concentrates on the theoretical and contains Benjamin Lee Whorf's "American Indian Model of the Universe" and chapters on Indian metaphysics, among other things.

They are the tiny, mighty force behind the pop in Champagne and the holes in Swiss cheese, the granite walls of Yosemite and the white cliffs of Dover, the workings of snowmaking machines, Botox, and gunpowder; and yet we tend to regard them as peripheral, disease-causing, food-spoiling troublemakers. In this book renowned microbiologist John Ingraham rescues these supremely important and ubiquitous microorganisms from their unwonted obscurity by showing us how we can, in fact, see them&#x2014;and appreciate their vast and varied role in nature and our lives. </p><p> Though we might not be able to see microbes firsthand, the consequences of their activities are readily apparent to our unaided senses. <i>March of the Microbes</i> shows us how to examine, study, and appreciate microbes in the manner of a birdwatcher, by making sightings of microbial activities and thereby identifying particular microbes as well as understanding what they do and how they do it. The sightings are as different as a smelly rock cod, a bottle of Chateau d&#x2019;Yquem, a moment in the Salem witch trials, and white clouds over the ocean. Together they summarize the impact of microbes on our planet, its atmosphere, geology, weather, and other organisms including ourselves, to whom they dole out fatal illnesses and vital nutrients alike. </p><p> In the end, Ingraham leaves us marveling at the power and persistence of microbes on our planet and gives credence to Louis Pasteur&#x2019;s famous assertion that &#x201c;microbes will have the last word.&#x201d; </p></p><p>John Ingraham is the former President of the American Society of Microbiologists, and Professor Emeritus of Microbiology at University of California, Davis.<i>March of the Microbes</i> is an impressive, entertaining tour of life's invisible realm. Combining history with new scientific discoveries, John Ingraham shows how microbes make their presence felt everywhere. You just have to know how to look for it. After reading this book, you will.<br> --Carl Zimmer, author of Microcosm: E. coli and the New Science of Life<br><br>Traverse the eclectic landscapes of soil, champagne, a Yellowstone spring, Italian salad dressing, and even the human stomach with microbiologist John L. Ingraham as your guide. This remarkable tour will transform novices into keen microbe--watchers in a mere 300 pages--which sounds like a lot, until you realize how much ground there is to cover in humanity's relationship with our most minuscule "friends." For instance, it was microbes that transformed the entire face of our planet, via the "Oxygen Revolution" some 3 billion years ago. We have them to thank for literally every breath we take. This is but one example. With the Earth estimated to have a nonillion (that's one followed by 30 zeros) microbes in and around it, we might as well get to know our tiny neighbors. (<i>Seed</i> 2010-02-01)<br><br>From the mundane (a smelly fish, a child with earache) to the exotic (hydrothermal vents), Ingraham presents the microbes behind so much of the world around us. He drives home the point that without these overlooked life forms we wouldn't be here at all...Ingraham's fresh perspective makes it an engaging read.<br> --Jo Marchant (<i>New Scientist</i> 2010-02-06)<br><br>Though most people are only familiar with microbes that cause disease (germs, etc.), those "felonious" microbes actually constitute a tiny percent of all microbes, and just a single chapter in this fascinating survey of single-celled organisms and their role in shaping life on Earth...Among other processes, Ingraham explains how vaccines have been developed, frequently with the aid of other microbes; the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles which make life possible; and how microbes give us cheese, wine, and other foodstuffs (though some, like xanthan gum, readers not to know about). Ingraham also discusses recently-discovered microbes inhabiting extreme environments (hot, cold, salty, etc.) that promise to tell us much about the evolution of life on Earth and what life on other planets might look like. Ingraham's entertaining, breezy style makes even difficult topics accessible, and every chapter contains intriguing anecdotes about microbes in history (did the CIA try to poison Castro's cigars with botulinum toxin?). Highly readable, engrossing, and endlessly informative, this is a standout example of science writing for general audiences. (<i>Publishers Weekly online (starred review)</i> 2010-04-26)<br><br>In this engaging treatment, the microbiologist shows readers the invisible world through observations about its macroscopic manifestations in a range of environments, from the kitchen to the abyss of the sea...Ingraham describes some of their malicious cousins who blight crops, kill trees, and sicken humans. Ingraham's clarity, plus touches of humor, augments the appeal of this fine contribution to popularizing science.<br> --Gilbert Taylor (<i>Booklist</i> 2010-02-01)<br><br>John Ingraham has written the definitive field guide for microbe watching, a branch of natural history that, to the uninitiated, might seem oxymoronic. Microorganisms being, by definition, creatures too small to be seen by the unaided eye...Read just a few pages, however, and the puzzle is solved. Sure, microbes are tiny, but they are so prolific that their effects on the world are both profound and highly visible--from the black mold on bathroom walls to the red tide that sporadically discolors and poisons long expanses of shoreline...He blends the deep knowledge of an academic with the passion of a microbe watcher extraordinaire--which makes this guide as entertaining as it is informative.<br> --Laurence A.

After leaving UB, Brett worked for a year as a visiting professor in marketing at Georgetown University. He was then lucky enough to work for about two years as a senior research analyst at Gallup. This was followed by two not-so-lucky years as a Program Director at the National Science Foundation. At the time of this writing (in January 2012) Brett was extremely excited to have just taken a position promoting graduate and postgraduate education in the Education Directorate at the American Psychological Association. With apologies to Lenny Bruce, you can see that Brett has had some difficulties holding down a regular job recently. The bulk of his research focuses on automatic social judgment and self-evaluation. Over the past two decades, he has taught courses in social psychology, research methods, statistics, social cognition, and the self-concept.

Justin du Rivage traces this decades-long debate, which pitted neighbors and countrymen against one another, from the War of Austrian Succession to the end of the American Revolution.<br> &nbsp;<br> As people from Boston to Bengal grappled with the growing burdens of imperial rivalry and fantastically expensive warfare, some argued that austerity and new colonial revenue were urgently needed to rescue Britain from unsustainable taxes and debts. Others insisted that Britain ought to treat its colonies as relative equals and promote their prosperity.

(Center for the Study of Language and Information)</h2><p><p>For many of us, the presidential election of 2000 was a wake-up call. The controversy following the vote count led to demands for election reform. But the new voting systems that were subsequently introduced to the market have serious security flaws, and many are confusing and difficult to use. Moreover, legislation has not kept up with the constantly evolving voting technology, leaving little to no legal recourse when votes are improperly counted. How did we come to acquire the complex technology we now depend on to count votes? &nbsp;Douglas Jones and Barbara Simons probe this question, along with public policy and regulatory issues raised by our voting technologies. &nbsp;Broken Ballots is a thorough and incisive analysis of the current voting climate that approaches American elections from technological, legal, and historical perspectives. &nbsp;The authors examine the ways in which Americans vote today, gauging how inaccurate, unreliable, and insecure our voting systems are. An important book for election administrators, political scientists, and students of government and technology policy, Broken Ballots is also a vital tool for any voting American.</p></p><p><i>Broken Ballots</i> begins with a comprehensive history of the use of technology in elections,starting with mechanical voting machines in the 19th century. Many of the problems that emerged then continue to plague modern electronic voting machines. The authors go on to illustrate how both legislation and the regulatory structure governing voting equipment have been ineffective at addressing technological risks - risks that frequently outstrip the understanding of election administrators and regulators. The result has been a series of failures where there is reason to doubt that the official vote count correctly reflected the intent of the voters. Both Democrats and Republicans have been the victims of these failures. The book ends with a prescriptive summary that includes recommendations for policies and legislation to better protect the democratic process.<br><br>Douglas W.

She expands its treatment of mechanics with more in-depth discussions of analysis and editorial judgment calls&#x2014;deciding what is and what is not indexable, and establishing the structure of entries. She also discusses the concept of indexing and how it fits into the publishing process; deciding when to prepare one's own index and when to hire a professional; deciphering publishers' indexing guidelines; and choosing appropriate software.<br><br>Mulvany's evaluation of available embedded and dedicated software is especially useful as a current guide to what works best for which tasks.

Mulvany teaches basic indexing at the University of California Extension in Berkeley."Mulvaney's book is widely used as a textbook in North America, and the release of a revised second edition will quite likely ensure its continued popularity. . . . I have utmost respect for anyone with enough patience to write, let alone revise, a thorough textbook that covers all aspects of indexing. Mulvaney's pertinent . . . discussions of important issues facing our profession gives this volume an importance beyond the realm of mere instruction." (Ruth Pincoe <i>The Indexer</i>)<br><br>"[<i>Indexing Books</i>] should be on every aspiring indexer's reading list." (<i>C&amp;RL News</i>)<br><br>"When you are an acknowledged leader in your field, and you have literally 'written the book' on indexing, what do you do for an encore? If you are Nancy Mulvany, professional indexer and author of the industry standard <i>Indexing Books</i>, you write a second edition that reflects the concerns of indexers in the 21st century." (Dick Evans <i>Technical Communication</i>)<br><br>"I am a huge fan of this book. It is engagingly written in jargon-free English with a well-designed format. I highly recommend it for all faculty of information studies libraries and those libraries that may have among their users would-be indexers or authors that are interested in knowing about the methods of indexing their books. . . . This second edition should replace the first edition on library shelves."&nbsp; (Jean Weihs <i>Technicalities</i>)</p><h2>Racist America: Roots, Current Realities, and Future Reparations</h2><p>Despite the apparent advances since the civil rights era, America remains fundamentally racist, argues award-winning author Joe Feagin. <em>Racist America</em> is a bold, thoughtful exploration of the ubiquity of race in contemporary life. From a black New Jersey dentist stopped by police more than 100 times for driving to work in an expensive car to the labourer who must defend his promotion against charges of undeserved affirmative action, Feagin lays bare the economic, ideologic, and political structure of American racism. In doing so he develops an antiracist theory rooted not only in the latest empirical data but also in the current reality of racism in the U.S.</p><p>Joe R. Feagin teaches sociology at the University of Floriday at Gainsville. He is the author of over thirty books including <i>The Agony of Education</i> and <i>White Racism</i>, all published by Routledge.A sometimes searing indictment of American racial practices.Sociologist Feagin (White Racism, not reviewed) traces the development of American racism to its roots in Europe. Ideologically, race was not a major consideration in human endeavors until the beginning of the European slave trade in the 1400s, Feagin tells us. But some 300 years later, it had grown full-blown and become a major cornerstone of intellectual thought--dominated by such thinkers as Locke, Kant, and Hegel, and by the Frenchman Joseph Arthur de Gobineau. All of these harbored anti-black views to varying degrees, including the curious natural-law notion that blacks somehow were born to be slaves. Much of this 18th-century twaddle was absorbed by our Founding Fathers, especially by Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and James Madison. Feagin also examines Reconstruction, the lynchings of the late&#x2013;19th and early&#x2013;20th centuries, the Civil Rights era, and the post&#x2013;Civil Rights period. As we enter a point in the new millennium where the white population is beginning to shrink, Feagin points out that less than half the population of America's four largest cities (New York, Los Angeles, Houston, and Chicago) is white. This and other factors lead Feagin to call for an international view of civil rights (i.e., one in which all are entitled to equal concern because all are human beings and not members of this or that state or tribe). Feagin, who is avowedly influenced by Franz Fanon and Kwame Ture (Stokely Carmichael), is at his overwrought best when he is in historical pursuit of the roots of racism. Perhaps because it is something not readily fresh on the mind, it is a matter of more than idle curiosity what Benjamin Franklin and James Madison thought about whiteness. On the other hand, matters such as affirmative action and reparations are too widely discussed and familiar to make Feagin's discussion of them very interesting or fresh.A useful study, even for those who are not guilt-ridden. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½ 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

The Nabokovs were known for their high culture and commitment to public service, and the elder Nabokov was an outspoken opponent of anti-Semitism and one of the leaders of the opposition party, the Kadets. In 1919, following the Bolshevik Revolution, he took his family into exile. Four years later he was shot and killed at a political rally in Berlin while trying to shield the speaker from right-wing assassins.&nbsp; The Nabokov household was trilingual, and as a child Nabokov was already reading Wells, Poe, Browning, Keats, Flaubert, Verlaine, Rimbaud, Tolstoy, and Chekhov alongside the popular entertainments of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Jules Verne. As a young man, he studied Slavic and romance languages at Trinity College, Cambridge, taking his honors degree in 1922. For the next&nbsp;18 years he lived in Berlin and Paris, writing prolifically in Russian under the pseudonym "Sirin" and supporting himself through translations, lessons in English and tennis, and by composing the first crossword puzzles in Russian. In 1925, he married Vera Slonim, with whom he had one child, a son, Dmitri.&nbsp; Having already fled Russia and Germany, Nabokov became a refugee once more in 1940, when he was forced to leave France for the United States. There he taught at Wellesley, Harvard, and Cornell. He also gave up writing in Russian and began composing fiction in English. His most notable works include <i>Bend Sinister&nbsp;</i>(1947),&nbsp;<i>Lolita</i>&nbsp;(1955),&nbsp;<i>Pnin</i>&nbsp;(1957), and&nbsp;<i>Pale Fire</i>&nbsp;(1962), as well as the translation of his earlier Russian novels into English. He also undertook English translations of works by Lermontov and Pushkin and wrote several books of criticism. Vladimir Nabokov died in Montreux, Switzerland, in 1977.Mysterious, sinister and beautifully melancholic -- Martin Amis</p><h2>The Lost World: Being an Account of the Recent Amazing Adventures of Professor George E. Challenger, Lord John Roxton, Professor Summerlee, and Mr ... the Daily Gazette (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>The first in Arthur Conan Doyle's series of books featuring the popular character of Professor Challenger, <em>The Lost World</em> is a classic tale of adventure and discovery. A scientific team embarks on an expedition to a South American plateau, where they find a seemingly impenetrable and dangerous world that has been frozen in time since the age of dinosaurs. The only edition with a critical introduction, this timeless story is sure to excite the modern reader.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p>Forget the Michael Crichton book (and Spielberg movie) that copied the title. This is the original: the terror-adventure tale of <i>The Lost World</i>. Writing not long after dinosaurs first invaded the popular imagination, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle spins a yarn about an expedition of two scientists, a big-game hunter, and a journalist (the narrator) to a volcanic plateau high over the vast Amazon rain forest. The bickering of the professors (a type Doyle knew well from his medical training) serves as witty contrast to the wonders of flora and fauna they encounter, building toward a dramatic moonlit chase scene with a Tyrannosaurus Rex. And the character of Professor George E. Challenger is second only to Sherlock Holmes in the outrageous force of his personality: he's a big man with an even bigger ego, and if you can grit your teeth through his racist behavior toward Native Americans, he's a lot of fun.6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Changing Light at Sandover: Including the whole of The Book of Ephraim, Mirabell&#39;s Books of Number, Scripts for the Pageant and a new coda, The Higher Keys</h2><p>Mystical poems explore the author&#39;s experiences communicating with a spirit named Ephraim through an Ouija board</p><p></p><h2>Biology of Plants</h2><p>Long acclaimed as the definitive introductory botany text for majors, Biology of Plants is especially known for its comprehensive coverage andits magnificent art program.

Schneier uses his extensive field experience with his own clients to dispel the myths that often mislead IT managers as they try to build secure systems. This practical guide provides readers with a better understanding of why protecting information is harder in the digital world, what they need to know to protect digital information, how to assess business and corporate security needs, and much more.<br> * Walks the reader through the real choices they have now for digital security and how to pick and choose the right one to meet their business needs<br> * Explains what cryptography can and can't do in achieving digital security</p><p>Whom can you trust? Try Bruce Schneier, whose rare gift for common sense makes his book <i>Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World</i> both enlightening and practical. He's worked in cryptography and electronic security for years, and has reached the depressing conclusion that even the loveliest code and toughest hardware still will yield to attackers who exploit human weaknesses in the users. The book is neatly divided into three parts, covering the turn-of-the-century landscape of systems and threats, the technologies used to protect and intercept data, and strategies for proper implementation of security systems. Moving away from blind faith in prevention, Schneier advocates swift detection and response to an attack, while maintaining firewalls and other gateways to keep out the amateurs.<p> Newcomers to the world of Schneier will be surprised at how funny he can be, especially given a subject commonly perceived as quiet and dull. Whether he's analyzing the security issues of the rebels and the Death Star in <i>Star Wars</i> or poking fun at the giant software and e-commerce companies that consistently sacrifice security for sexier features, he's one of the few tech writers who can provoke laughter consistently. While moderately pessimistic on the future of systems vulnerability, he goes on to relieve the reader's tension by comparing our electronic world to the equally insecure paper world we've endured for centuries--a little smart-card fraud doesn't seem so bad after all. Despite his unfortunate (but brief) shill for his consulting company in the book's afterword, you can trust Schneier to dish the dirt in <i>Secrets and Lies</i>. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>More Reviews <p>"As a thoughtful read, prior to planning or reviewing your business's security strategy, you could not do better...."

It is our mother, forgiving, embracing, naming the world and all its emotions. Though I have lived for the last forty years in cities where English or French is the language of the majority, it&#x2019;s Bangla that exercises motherly restraint over my provisional, immigrant identity. Mother-Bangla is fixed; I haven&#x2019;t learned a new word nor had new thought or feeling in Bangla for nearly half a century. I don&#x2019;t need to. According to group-norms, as a native-born speaker, I have automatic membership in the world&#x2019;s most articulate, most imaginative and most intelligent club. With its brazen appeals to love and vanity, enforced with coercive guilt, the language sabotages irony towards the community&#x2019;s billowing self-esteem. Like a child whose mother might tipple or stray, I look for excuses, cannot condemn. To my inner Bengali I remain constant, as it does for me.<br><br>How exclusive can a club of nearly a quarter-billion members be? Bangla is the language of Bangladesh, the eighth most populous nation in the world, and of the Indian state of West Bengal, the second-largest linguistic group in India. Millions more, documented or not, have settled abroad. Impressive numbers aside, every Bengali, to her at least, is a majority of one. We harbor the faith, implanted by myth and history, of our exalted place in the hierarchy of breeding and culture.<br><br>To international relief agency workers, Bangla is the mother tongue of esurient poverty, but to the heirs of shonar bangla, golden Bengal of harvest-ready paddyfields and fish-filled rivers, it is the mother tongue of poetry, passion and abundance. It is also the language of nostalgia and of tentative hope: nostalgia for the Hindu-Muslim harmony that existed in undivided Bengal before its vindictive partition by the fleeing British; and hope for the shared mother tongue, devotion to the possible tomorrow that will transcend the religious furies exploited by today&#x2019;s politicians. I think a shared language is stronger than divisive religions. (Based on my travels in Bangladesh, I think Hindu and Muslim Bengalis could cross the abyss between them. It&#x2019;s the national politics of India and corrupt fiefdoms in Bangladesh that get in the way.)<br><br>Up to age eight, I lived exclusively in Bangla. My father was the sole support of forty to fifty relatives, who lived with us crowded together in the ground-floor apartment of a two-storied house in a homogenously Hindu, Bangla-speaking, middle-class neighborhood of Kolkata (until recently mispronounced and misspelled as Calcutta by colonialists). All the adults in our large household had been born in villages or towns in the Dhaka (then &#x201c;Dacca&#x201d;) district of East Bengal (now Bangladesh); all their children, my sisters and cousins, in the thriving capital, Kolkata, in West Bengal. Among themselves, the adults spoke the dialect of Dhaka, the children the Bangla of Kolkata. I had no idea as a child that linguists considered the Dhaka dialect &#x201c;deviant,&#x201d; and Kolkata the standard. In our home the Dhaka dialect, bangal, was the language of authenticity. You are what dialect your forefathers spoke even if you yourself have lost fluency in it be- cause of successive migrations. We were east Bengalis or bangal first, then Bengali. We distanced ourselves from west Bengalis or ghoti who surrounded us and considered us interlopers. We conducted ourselves as bangal, exiled permanently from our ancestral homeland. <br><br> To be born a displaced bangal was to inherit loss of, and longing for, one&#x2019;s true home. Identity had to do with mother tongue, but home was the piece of land that our forefathers had owned, the soil that they had slept and walked on. To be cast out of your janma bhumi or ancestral birth-soil is to be forever doomed. Unlike dialects, which can be transported by migrants, the loss of janma bhumi is permanent. The diasporic Bengali may own real estate in the country of her adoption, but that real estate can only be her residence, as provisional as her immigrant identity, her home. I think now that this intimate braiding of inherited language, place and identity is why Bengalis never took to the British system of primogeniture. Generation by generation, the extent of ancestral land owned by an individual male was whittled down to specks and strips. It didn&#x2019;t matter that the shrunken land was unprofitable for cultivation and support of large families. Second, third, fourth . . . eighth, ninth. Sons didn&#x2019;t emigrate; they just stayed and got poorer. Evaluation was symbolic, not economic. <br><br>Even as a child I picked up on our linguistic nuancing of house (basha, bari ), room (ghar), land (jomi), soil (bhumi) and homeland (desh). My cousins and I were alert to the moral of the countless children&#x2019;s stories about villagers willing to starve rather than sell off inherited strips of bhumi. The most menacing refrain from a popular poem we learned by rote was a rich, greedy landowner&#x2019;s threatening a desperately poor farmer, &#x201c;Do you get it, Upen / I&#x2019;m going to buy up your land.&#x201d; Even now in comfortable San Francisco, with every mortgage and property tax payment, I can be thrown into panic by that simple refrain. (Refinance? Never! Lock it in and forget about it, like immigrants or Depression-era survivors who distrust banks.) The in- herited culture insists that accidents of impulse and geography have made homelessness my permanent condition; the adopted culture tries to persuade me that home is where I choose to invest love and loyalty.<br><br>Better colleges, better job opportunities, natural disasters like floods and famines, and periodic flarings of Hindu-Muslim antago- nism had induced my parents&#x2019; immediate families to migrate to Kolkata in the 1920s and 1930s, though they still owned land in their hometowns. My father had been sent to Kolkata to stay with a childless aunt and uncle-in-law so that he could get a sound English-language undergraduate education at St. Xavier&#x2019;s College, run by Jesuits from Belgium. By then a scholarship student, he stayed for graduate degrees in applied chemistry. After that, as the most educated though not the eldest of nine sons, he dutifully looked for a job in Kolkata, the most prosperous of Bengal&#x2019;s cities. Dependents and family friends also in need of free food and lodging started arriving from the east as soon as they&#x2019;d heard that he was job-hunting. For a while, the houseguests commuted from Kolkata to their homes in provincial towns of eastern Bengal, where they still jointly owned an ancestral strip. <br><br>The Hindu-Muslim riots of 1946, the fiercest in communal memory, drove the last of the Mukherjee clan out of their hometown, where Muslims constituted an overwhelming majority. The refugees brought with them tales of arson, rape and looting. From their tears and nightmare-hour screams, I learned the special resonance that bhoi, the Bangla word for fear, carries. There is no English equivalence for the scale of terror that bhoi implies. In words such as bhoi, the individual experience of fear is shot through with the memory of unspeakable communal suffering. The partitioning of Bengal in 1947 transformed my vast, extended family from commuters shuttling between residence of convenience and homeland to political refugees stranded in a city where they could never belong. Kolkata was their begrudged place of asylum.<br><br>That exilic melancholy was passed on to me in infancy. We refugees were different from, and superior to, ghoti Bengalis. Which end of the soft-boiled egg do you crack, and should we go to war over it? We rejected matchmaking between ghoti families and ours. We made fun of the ghoti inability to pronounce the &#x201c;l&#x201d; sound in lebu (lemon) and loochi (deep-fried bread). Whenever the East Bengal soccer team played Mohun Bagan, the West Bengal team, we conducted ourselves not as well-brought-up young women but as rowdy soccer fans. The ghoti, in turn, stereotyped us as provincial bumpkins. We directed our Us- versus-Them pugnacity to people who spoke dialects other than the Dhaka one within the bangal community. Long before I had heard of Freud, I had enacted &#x201c;the narcissism of small differences.&#x201d;<br><br>In our house, bangal was the language of passion and of discipline. Unhappy wives threatened death by fasting in bangal; virtuous virgins gossipped about neighborhood sluts in it; headstrong young uncles swore at each other in it. Whenever my father had to assume the unwelcome role of patriarch and punish unseemly behavior by a relative, he first, in bangal, consulted his widowed mother, an autocratic upholder of conservative traditions. I remember bangal, however, mainly for the ancient doggerels that my paternal grandmother&#x2019;s coterie of tobacco-chewing, osteoporosis-bent widows recited for their deft delivery of sexist cruelty. Day in and day out, these widows tormented my mother for having borne three daughters and no sons. I may be walking on Haight Street, but I still hear them repeat their malicious couplets: Puter mutey kori / Meyer galai dori (There&#x2019;s money to be made off a son&#x2019;s piss / There&#x2019;s rope to hang a daughter with).<br><br>My mother tongue transmitted unambiguously the society&#x2019;s values and taboos. Literacy turned women rebellious, unsubmissive, and unmarriageable. My mother, who had been married off the moment she had finished high school, was abused regularly by her in-laws, first for daring to express the hope that she might enroll in a women&#x2019;s college, and later for wanting to send her three daughters to the best elementary school for girls, which happened not to be in our neighborhood. There were harangues and beatings. I didn&#x2019;t realize at the time that I was not just a child-spectator of a scene of authorized sado-masochism, but that I was witness to the last chapters of a long, cultural mega-upheaval. Only very recently, while researching the battle between the Hinducentric traditionalists and the Europhilic re- formists (the Brahmo-Samaj) for a novel, I came across a doggerel that has relocated those childhood scenes of pain inflicted and pain accepted in the context of nationalist struggles. Likhey porey ranhr / buley jano udome shanhr.<br><br>The doggerel is in a colloquial bangla long out of usage. An educated woman is a woman without a husband / Like an untethered ox, she roams around. On the surface, its moral is familiar and unambiguous: educated women threaten tradi- tion. But the literal translation does not convey the anonymous versifier&#x2019;s hidden linguistic ambiguities and cultural codes. Ranhr describes a husbandless woman, who might be a widow (an unfortunate fate in a society that advocates sati), or an unmarried woman (a worse fate in a society that expects a woman to worship God through worshipping her husband), or a prosti- tute. The adjective udome that characterizes the ox of the doggerel&#x2019;s analogy can be correctly translated as both &#x201c;untied&#x201d; and &#x201c;naked.&#x201d; Buley is the third person conjugation of the verb bula (to roam, loiter, barge in). These ambiguities evoke malicious connections between a woman allowed to learn the three Rs and a loitering whore, who preys on the very society that has cast her out. But, for the bangla-speaker, this pejorative connotation is undermined or even negated by the great medieval Bengali poet Govinda Das&#x2019;s application of the verb bula to the wanderings of poets. In our linguistic community, the poet or kavi is not only an artist and entertainer, as she or he might be in the West; the poet is the visionary revealer of ultimate cosmic mysteries. I inherited a mother tongue charged with contradictions and nuances. The capacity of diction to imply opposite meanings has fed me even as I write fiction in English.<br><br>(Bangla is not unique in that regard. An Israeli poet friend of my husband&#x2019;s, Ronny Someck, once described modern Hebrew as an amalgam of two sources: the ancient Bible and the modern army. According to him, many words and most poems in that language can be read in at least two ironic, sometimes comic and often-pornographic ways.)<br><br>So it was that through chhara (lullabies), proverbs, and do- mestic squabbles, I intuited the dues and privileges of membership in the bangla-speakers&#x2019; club. My formal training in ladylike behavior was undertaken by my paternal grandmother (the same full-throated widow who harangued my mother for wanting to educate us sisters). She herself had been taught to read as a child by her older sister, a childless woman whose husband&#x2014;picked out by my paternal great-grandfather for his potential to earn a good living as a doctor in Kolkata&#x2014;turned out to have pro- gressive ideas. Every night, though we children would have preferred to listen to ghost stories told with dramatic sound effect by a retired servant who had stayed on with us, this grandmother recited episodes from the bangla-version of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.<br><br>Of the two epics, the Ramayana was my favorite. What young girl could not thrill to the sheer romance? The handsome and virtuous prince, Ram, legal heir to the throne of his polyga- mous father, is banished to the forest. His aged father is in thrall to a young wife with ambitions to get her own issue appointed as crown prince. (Didn&#x2019;t we know such stories from the neighborhood, or, indeed, from our own family?) The subsequent adventures of the banished Ram include wife kidnapping and Homeric-scale war for wife-rescuing, martial victory and the final installation of Ram the rightful king. How pale in comparison are Helen and Paris, Greece and Troy. It&#x2019;s such a good story, with its incorporation of shape-changing demons and deities into everyday reality. I thrilled to the narrative clutter, the strong plot and the balancing of violence and tenderness. And under all the convolutions and endless adumbration, it is true to the psychological tensions within the extended family. I was already in training to be a novelist.<br><br>As a writer, I&#x2019;m sometimes taken to task for linking too many narratives, turning family stories into murder mysteries, indulging myself in violence, ramming ancient history into contemporary reality, dipping into voices and situations (the discredited charge of &#x201c;appropriation&#x201d;) far beyond my personal experience. Well, blame the Ramayana.<br><br> My habit of scavenging the world&#x2019;s legacy for ideas and for vocabulary, then reshaping them until they comfortably belong to me, is something I must have picked up unconsciously, in infancy. For all our proud insistence on exclusivity, Bengalis (particularly those from Kolkata) have absorbed words from peoples we have come into contact with through trade, wars, migration and marriage, without feeling it a violation of our core identity. Persian was the pre-British court language (and still in circulation during the British Raj); therefore, from Persian we have golap, the word for rose, and ostad, the term for a master musician. Even the famous Anglo-Indian, Victorian word durbar, the elaborate imperial tent and ceremonial display of power, and the refreshing drink, sharbat, come from Persian. From a long exposure to Portuguese traders came words like toali for towel, janla for window, almira for almirah or large wooden cabinet. From the British, who made &#x201c;Calcutta&#x201d; the traditional seat of power, we got the courts, the schools, parks, the museums and luxurious residences. We also got the first brush with the authority of the English language&#x2014;and two hundred years&#x2019; indoctrination in our backwardness. Indianized English words, such as tebil for table, pulish for police, kabard for cupboard, and (my favorite) tikoji for tea-cozy, trail a certain colonial shame. Other aspects of the British linguistic presence, which I will return to later, are far more interesting, or damaging, according to one&#x2019;s interpretation. <br><br>In our home, we o...</p><h2>Applied Numerical Analysis</h2><p><p> <b> </b> The seventh edition of this classic text has retained the features that make it popular, while updating its treatment and inclusion of Computer Algebra Systems and Programming Languages.

We find there an entire world of unregulated, unreported, and untaxed work, a system of living off the books that is daily life in the ghetto. From women who clean houses and prepare lunches for the local hospital to small-scale entrepreneurs like the mechanic who works in an alley; from the preacher who provides mediation services to the salon owner who rents her store out for gambling parties; and from street vendors hawking socks and incense to the drug dealing and extortion of the local gang, we come to see how these activities form the backbone of the ghetto economy. </p><p> What emerges are the innumerable ways that these men and women, immersed in their shadowy economic pursuits, are connected to and reliant upon one another. The underground economy, as Venkatesh's subtle storytelling reveals, functions as an intricate web, and in the strength of its strands lie the fates of many Maquis Park residents. The result is a dramatic narrative of individuals at work, and a rich portrait of a community. But while excavating the efforts of men and women to generate a basic livelihood for themselves and their families, <i>Off the Books</i> offers a devastating critique of the entrenched poverty that we so often ignore in America, and reveals how the underground economy is an inevitable response to the ghetto's appalling isolation from the rest of the country. </p></p><p><b>Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh</b> is Professor of Sociology and African-American Studies at Columbia University.In this revealing study of a Southside Chicago neighborhood, sociologist Venkatesh opens a window on how the poor live...Venkatesh keeps his work vital and poignant by using the words of his subjects. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2006-09-04)<br><br>[Venkatesh] spent years in a 10-square-block neighborhood on Chicago's South Side observing the clandestine work of gangbangers and mechanics, prostitutes and pastors. The result, <i>Off the Books: The Underground Economy of the Urban Poor</i>, suggests that in some American neighborhoods, the underground economy is a source not just of sustenance but of order, and that while shady transactions may be illegal, they adhere to a distinctive and sophisticated set of laws. (Patrick Radden Keefe <i>Slate.com</i> 2006-12-08)<br><br>Remember the Chicago grad student in <i>Freakonomics</i> who figured out why drug dealers live with their mothers? His name is Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh, and his new book, <i>Off the Books: The Underground Economy of the Urban Poor</i>, is the riveting drug-dealer back story--and a lot more. Venkatesh, who is now a professor of sociology and African-American studies at Columbia, spent 1995 to 2003 following the money in 10 square blocks of the Chicago ghetto. He finds an intricate underground web. In it are dealers and prostitutes--and also pastors who take their money, nannies who don't report income, unlicensed cab drivers, off-the-books car mechanics, purveyors of home-cooked soul food, and homeless men paid to sleep outside stores. Venkatesh's insight is that the neighborhood doesn't divide between 'decent' and 'street'--almost everyone has a foot in both worlds. 'Don't matter in some ways if it's the gang or the church,' says one woman as she describes the network that gives her some sense of security. <i>The Wire</i> meets academia, <i>Off the Books</i> is a great and an instructive read. (Emily Bazelon <i>Slate.com</i> 2006-12-07)<br><br>[Venkatesh] examines the underground economy of a poor Chicago neighborhood and discovers a thriving system of licit and illicit exchange. Although the resourcefulness of certain drug dealers, back-alley mechanics, and fly-by-night day-care providers is remarkable, Venkatesh argues that under-the-table transactions work to further separate their participants from the economic mainstream. (Benjamin Healy <i>The Atlantic</i> 2006-12-01)<br><br>In <i>Off the Books</i>, Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh defines the underground economy as 'a web in which many different people, from the criminal to the pious, from the down-and-out to the bourgeois, are inextricably intertwined'...The story Venkatesh tells in <i>Off the Books</i> is specific to Maquis Park, but the underground economy he found there almost certainly has its counterpart in the black ghettos of large cities. Indeed, its reach extends beyond the ghetto to the kitchens of restaurants, the homes of the well-off and the myriad service jobs that employ workers off the books. Yet it remains in the shadows, barely touched by researchers, a vast world usually ignored, misunderstood, or dismissed with stereotypes. Venkatesh's riveting account describes the underground economy through vividly realized characters...[His] dissection of Maquis Park's underground economy overturns one stereotype and common assumption about the urban poor after another...Venkatesh finds the underground economy's origins in the racism, economic devastation, and political abandonment that have decimated many big American cities...What can be done? Venkatesh offers no concrete remedies. But that is not his point. <i>Off the Books</i> is not about policy. Wonderfully written, brilliantly researched, it illuminates, as no other book has done, the ubiquitous world of shady activities that structure everyday life for the residents of the nation's Maquis Parks in ways few Americans observe or understand. (Michael B. Katz <i>Chicago Tribune</i> 2006-11-26)<br><br>Venkatesh paints a detailed picture that reflects his close acquaintance with the neighborhood, moving from businesses that are legal but off the books to those that are entirely outside the law and talking to home-based food preparers and preachers, street hustlers and gang members...This is a Chicago you don't know, told in readable prose that puts most other sociologists to shame. (Harold Henderson <i>Chicago Reader</i>)<br><br>In Sudhir Venkatesh's newly published <i>Off the Books: The Underground Economy of the Urban Poor</i>, readers are introduced to a cast-royale of rogues, some loveable, others little short of detestable, who inhabit a super-isolated ghetto neighborhood in Southside Chicago...For four hundred pages, Venkatesh describes in intimate detail the often bizarre world of economic relationships in this urban edge zone, largely outside the web of economic, political, legal, and law-enforcement structures that dominate mainstream American life. The result is a compelling, deeply disturbing ground-level view of today's underclass...His approach--offering a pastiche of images of the ghetto economy rather than bombarding readers with statistics on income levels, life expectancy, and so forth--firmly situates Venkatesh in a long tradition of writers preoccupied with anecdotally chronicling America's underside and crafting verbal portraits of the colorful, often entertaining misfits on the margins...Overall, this is a fascinating look at a place and community that would otherwise remain entirely under the radar. If our economy and society throws up such spectacular inequalities, at the very least we owe it to the poorest of the poor to try to understand their lives, their struggles, their pain. Venkatesh takes us into this world; it's an often-ugly place, but, as <i>Off the Books</i> shows, it is also one that is strangely compelling. (Sasha Abramsky <i>American Prospect Online</i> 2007-01-10)<br><br>[A] remarkable book. (Paul Seabright <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2007-06-22)<br><br>[Venkatesh] immersed himself in Maquis Park, a poor black neighborhood on Chicago&#x2019;s Southside...He discovered and analyzed the diverse forms of unregulated, unreported, and untaxed work of small business owners. This &#x201c;off the books&#x201d; world thrives due to residents&#x2019; lack of human capital, high entry costs, poverty, and social isolation. Venkatesh&#x2019;s analysis weaves hair salons, auto repairs, pimps, drug dealers, block club leaders, ministers, and gang leaders into an intricate web of exchange networks. Varied individuals are also called upon to mediate conflicts in the neighborhood. Venkatesh concludes that without significant changes in inner cities, the underground will flourish.

Building your word power will help you write more effectively, communicate clearly, score higher on standardized tests like the SAT, ACT, or GRE, and be more confident and persuasive in everything you do.<br><br>But in order to truly increase your vocabulary, you need a system that works. With most guides, you end up only memorizing the new words for a short time, often not even long enough to use them in tests. Fiske WordPower is different.<br><br>Using the exclusive Fiske system, you will not just memorize words, but truly learn their meanings and how to use them correctly. This knowledge will stay with you longer and be easier to recall-and it doesn't take any longer than less-effective memorization.<br><br>How does it work? This book uses a simple three-part system:<br>1. Patterns: Words aren't arranged randomly or alphabetically, but in similar groups that make words easier to remember over time.<br>2. Deeper Meanings, More Examples: Full explanations-not just brief definitions-of what the words mean, plus multiple examples of the words in sentences.<br>3. Quick Quizzes: Frequent short quizzes help you test how much you've learned, while helping your brain internalize their meanings.<br><br>Fiske WordPower is the most effective system for building a vocabulary that gets you clear and successful results. <br></p><p>Edward B. Fiske served for 17 years as education editor of the New York Times, and authors the Fiske Guide to Colleges. <br><br>Jane Mallison has more than twenty years of experience teaching English and has been a member of the College Board SAT committee. <br><br>Margery Mandell has an MA in English from Columbia and is the coauthor of Million Dollar Words.Have you ever learned a new word and then immediately seen or heard it again? Let's say you just learned exotic ("out of the ordinary") and within a week you see an ad for "exotic tropical fruit drinks," hear someone talk about "traveling to exotic places," and find a reference in a history text to the fact that in the eighteenth century the English considered Italian opera "exotic" entertainment." Spooky? Mystical? Weird? Not really. <br> <br>The universe didn't suddenly thrust those words in your path to reward you for your new knowledge. No, it's the other way around-you noticed the word because you'd just learned it. (The same phenomenon occurs when people plan to buy, say, a used car or an engagement ring. Suddenly their worldview becomes newly aware that some cars have two doors and some have four, that Aunt Tilda has a huge pear-shaped diamond.) In short, you're developing what we call strong verbal antennae, an ability to sense what you earlier ignored. These antennae will be your new best friends. If writers are, as novelist Henry James suggested, people "on whom nothing is lost," then alpha students of vocabulary are people on whom no word is lost. If you see it, learn it. If you hear it, learn it. If you learn it, use it. <br><br>The system in this book is designed to help you fully learn the one thousand words inside. However, there are many things you can, and should, do to make the process easier as well as to learn new words that aren't even in this book. <br><br>Rule #1: Get the proper tools. <br>No wordsmith worthy of the name will be without a good dictionary-or maybe even dictionaries. If it's possible, have several-one at home, one at school or in your workplace, and maybe even a portable dictionary to carry with you so you can check a meaning whenever you come across a word that pleases you. <br><br>Rule #2: Don't be shy. <br>If someone uses a word you don't know, ask what it means. When the father of your best friend says he's tired of hearing people pontificate, you can quickly learn that it means "speaking in a preachy manner." No, people won't think you're stupid for asking; they'll feel good about teaching you something. <br><br>Rule #3: Find a way to capture those exotic new words. <br>Maybe you'll carry a small notebook with you and jot them down quickly. If you prefer an electronic device, that's fine too. Just don't let them get away. Then, be sure to follow through with the next step-learning the meaning of your new words. (See the box on pages 6 to 8 for some suggestions to make this process easier.) <br><br>Rule #4: Consider the possibility of a study buddy. <br>If you know someone who's also motivated to build his or her vocabulary, ask that person to study with you. The same principle that has made Weight Watchers successful for dieters can build your word power. Studying with another person can keep you motivated and make practicing the recommended techniques more fun. For example, your fellow Word Watcher may know some of the words on your list (see Rule #2), saving you the effort of looking them up; similarly, your partner can share his or her list of new words with you. <br><br>Rule #5: Employ interstitial learning. <br>This fancy adjective refers to "space between cracks," in this case, small spaces of time. Study whenever you have a small bit of time. You'll be amazed how studying whenever you have a little bit of time can add up. A successful book for students in graduate school is called Writing Your Dissertation in Fifteen Minutes a Day. If someone a little older than you can write a long scholarly treatise using such a method, you can build your vocabulary in even smaller units of time. So however silly it may initially feel, get out that list, those cards (see Rule #6 below), while you're waiting for the bus or sitting in the dentist's waiting room. Your new bits of knowledge will add up quickly. <br><br>Rule #6: Different techniques.<br>Try several techniques for getting newly noticed words into your memory, into your vocabulary. Learning styles differ from person to person, and you'll be able to determine fairly quickly what works best for you. <br><br>Flash Cards: A system of flash cards (3" x 5") with one word per card, definition on the back of the card, offers little in novelty, but its familiarity doesn't cancel out its effectiveness. Your ever-growing pack can fit in your bookbag or your pocket, readily available at a moment's notice.<br><br>Silly Sentences. Make up sentences using your new words, the sillier the better. These are even more fun if you're learning words in a partnership. You'll both remember the day you asked Max if he had done any ancillary reading, and after only a brief pause, he slyly replied, "Oh, yes, an egregious amount." (ancillary = extra, egregious = outstandingly bad) <br><br>Story Time. Think about expanding the sentence idea into the writing of a little story. You don't have to write it down. You can just run it through your head while you're brushing your teeth. Take twenty words you're trying to master and see how many you can use in retelling, say, an old fairy tale or the plot of a movie you just saw. Little Red Riding Hood will find herself in an umbrageous (shaded) area with a nefarious (wicked) wolf waiting to accost (suddenly speak to) her. Or, the virile (manly) actor will be planning to avenge (get revenge for) the wrong done to his pulchritudinous (beautiful) sister. What happens next in each of these scenarios? What new words can you use to build the plot?<br><br>Mnemonic Devices. Employ mnemonic devices (memory tricks) whenever they come to you. If you fix ravenous (very hungry) in your head by thinking of some really hungry black birds, no representative of the Word Police is going to come arrest you for ignoring the fact that the adjective doesn't come from the name of the bird. Don't censor your silly associations; if they walk into your mind, they'll help you remember. Watch that saturnine (gloomy) man get into his Saturn and be unhappy that he's out of gas!<br><br>Root Words. While your mnemonic devices can float free of the root meanings of words, do help yourself another way by building some knowledge in this area. For example, if you learn that "pli" is a root referring to bending or folding (think "two-ply" tissues"), then you've smoothed the road to learning implicate, explicate, implicit, explicit, complicate, supplication, pliant, and some other "pli" cousins. If you're lucky enough to have experience with a foreign language such as Latin, Spanish, or French in your present or your past, you can make strong connections with words you've learned in that area. <br><br>Prefixes and Suffixes. Similarly, mastering some basic prefixes and suffixes can help. If you know that "a" at the start of many words means "absence of" (think of amoral-absence of morals-or apathy-absence of feelings), you'll be ready to make some informed guesses. (If I approach the world in an ahistorical manner, am I a dedicated student of the past?) Likewise, if I think how insecticide kills insects, I'm set up to conquer homicide, fratricide, genocide, and regicide (killing of a person, a brother, a group of people related in some way, a king).</p><h2>Lost Horizon: A Novel</h2><p>James Hilton&#x2019;s famous utopian adventure novel, and the origin of the mythical sanctuary Shangri-La, receives new life in this beautiful reissue from Harper Perennial. A book that the New Yorker calls &#x201c;the most artful kind of suspense . . . ingenuity [we] have rarely seen equaled,&#x201d; <em>Lost Horizon </em>captured the national consciousness when first published in the 1930s, and Frank Capra&#x2019;s 1937 film adaptation catapulted it to the height of cultural significance.

Author Chester Himes had intended to write a book based on his own prison experiences, but when publisher after publisher turned it down, Himes rewrote the text. He turned his third-person narrative into a first-person narrative, eliminated flashbacks, and toned down the sometimes poetic language. The revision became, so the new editors tell us, "a hard-boiled prison novel." Finally restored in the form of the original novel, <i>Yesterday Will Make You Cry</i> is the heartfelt book Himes would have had us read: it is occasionally brutal, always uncompromising, and sometimes harrowingly moving.Chester Himes was the author of the legendary series of Harlem police procedurals starring Coffin Ed and Gravedigger Jones.

Page by page, Derman details his adventures in this field&#x2014;analyzing the incompatible personas of traders and quants, and discussing the dissimilar nature of knowledge in physics and finance. Throughout this tale, he also reflects on the appropriate way to apply the refined methods of physics to the hurly-burly world of markets.</p><p>"Derman's memoir of his transition from mathematical physicist to expert finance whiz at Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers reads like a novel, but tells a lot about brains applied to making money grow."<br> -Paul A. Samuelson, MIT, Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences, 1970<br> <br> "Not only a delightful memoir, but one full of information, both about people and their enterprise. I never thought that I would be interested in quantitative financial analysis, but reading this book has been a fascinating education."<br> -Jeremy Bernstein, author of Oppenheimer: Portrait of an Enigma<br> <br> "This wonderful autobiography takes place in that special time when scientists discovered Wall Street and Wall Street discovered them. It is elegantly written by a gifted observer who was a pioneering member of the new profession of financial engineering, with an evident affection both for finance as a science and for the scientists who practice it. Derman's portrait of how the academics brought their new financial science to the world of business and forever changed it and, especially, his descriptions of the late and extraordinary genius Fischer Black who became his mentor, reveal a surprising humanity where it might be least expected. Who should read this book? Anyone with a serious interest in finance and everyone who simply wants to enjoy a good read."<br> -Stephen Ross, Franco Modigliani Professor of Finance and Economics, Sloan School, MIT<br> <br> " ... a deep and elegant exploration by a thinker who moved from the hardest of all sciences (physics) to the softest of the soft (finance). Derman is a different class of thinker; unlike most financial economists, he bears no physics envy and focuses on exploring the real intuitions behind the mechanisms themselves. In addition to stories and portraits, the book documents, in vivid detail, the methods of knowledge transfer. I know of no other book that bridges the two cultures. Finally, I am happy to discover that Derman has a third career: he is a writer."<br> -Nassim Taleb, author of Fooled by Randomness<br> <br> "The quintessential quarky quant, Emanuel Derman has it all. Physicist, mathematician, philosopher, and poet blend together to produce a narrative that all financial engineers will find worth reading."<br> -Mark Rubinstein, Paul Stephens Professor of Applied Investment Analysis, University of California, BerkeleyWall Street is no longer the old-fashioned business it once was. In recent years, investment banks and hedge funds have increasingly turned to quantitative trading strategies and derivative securities for their profits, and have raided academia for PhDs to model these volatile products and manage their risk. Nowadays, the fortunes of firms and the stability of markets often rest on mathematical models. "Quants"-the scientifically trained practitioners of quantitative finance who build these models-have become key players on the Wall Street stage.<br> <br> And no Wall Street quant is better known than Emanuel Derman. One of the first high-energy particle physicists to migrate to Wall Street, he spent seventeen years in the business, eventually becoming managing director and head of the renowned Quantitative Strategies group at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. There he coauthored some of today's most widely used and influential financial models.<br> <br> Physics and quantitative finance look deceptively similar. But, writes Derman, "When you do physics you're playing against God; in finance, you're playing against God's creatures." How can one justify using the precise methods of physics in the frenzied world of financial markets? Is it reasonable to treat the economy and its markets as a complex machine? Or is quantitative finance merely flawed thinking masquerading as science, a brave whistling in the dark?<br> <br> My Life as a Quant is Derman's entertaining and candid account of his search for answers as he undergoes his transformation from ambitious young scientist to managing director. His book is simultaneously wide-ranging and personal. He tells the story of his passage between two worlds; he recounts his adventures with physicists, quants, options traders, and other highfliers on Wall Street; he analyzes the incompatible personas of traders and quants; and he meditates on the dissimilar natures of knowledge in physics and finance. Throughout his tale, he reflects on the appropriate way to apply the refined methods of physics to the hurly-burly world of markets.<br> <br> My Life as a Quant is a unique first-person story and a perceptive and revealing exploration of the quantitative side of Wall Street.</p><h2>A Child&#39;s Garden of Verses</h2><p>A collection of poems evoking the world and feelings of childhood.</p><p><blockquote><i> "The world is so full of a number of things, I'm sure we should all be as happy as kings."</i> </blockquote><p> With this "Happy Thought," Robert Louis Stevenson speaks for all the delights of childhood. But he doesn't stop there. <i>A Child's Garden of Verses</i>, written over a century ago, is filled to the brim with what are usually considered to be the first real poems written for children. This classic volume is an old friend to the generations of readers who were brought up on "I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me/ And what can be the use of him is more than I can see." In this perfectly lovely edition, the gossamer art of Jessie Willcox Smith (who first illustrated Stevenson's poems in the early years of the 20th century) is reproduced in all its charming glory. Black and white drawings throughout and eight full-page, warmly colorful paintings show beautiful, yet pleasantly imperfect children, busy at their daily activities--climbing trees, watching their reflections in a river, or sick in bed with an army of toy soldiers on guard. Place this on the shelf next to Mother Goose, Dr. Seuss, and Peter Rabbit. (All ages) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>First published in 1885, Stevenson&#39;s verses so truly reflect the feelings of young children--about being small, the bliss of going up in a swing so high, discovering one&#39;s shadow, happiness and sorrow and dreaming--that they have never ceased to be an essential part of a child&#39;s library.

Fleeing from pirates, Robinson Crusoe is swept ashore in a storm possessing only a knife, a box of tobacco, a pipe-and the will to survive. His is the saga of a man alone: a man who overcomes self-pity and despair to reconstruct his life; who painstakingly teaches himself how to fashion a pot, bake bread, build a canoe; and who, after twenty-four agonizing years of solitude, discovers a human footprint in the sand... Consistently popular since its first publication in 1719, Daniel Defoe's story of human endurance in an exotic, faraway land exerts a timeless appeal. The first important English novel, <b>Robinson Crusoe</b> has taken its rightful place among the great myths of Western civilization.</p><p><p>Thought to have been inspired by the true-life experiences of a marooned sailor, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> tells the story of the sole survivor of a shipwreck, stranded on a Caribbean island, who prevails against all odds, enduring three decades of solitude while mastering both himself and his strange new world. First published in 1719, the novel has long been one of the English language's great adventure stories.<br>In the journal he shares with us, the endearing, goatskin-clad castaway recounts the details of his lonely existence and his many adventures, including a fierce battle with cannibals and a daring rescue of Friday, the man who becomes his trusted servant and companion. Defoe's brilliant and imaginative use of detail renders Crusoe's island world utterly convincing. In reclaiming his humanity from the savagery of his circumstances, the hero humbly acquires the qualities of courage, patience, ingenuity, and industry.</p><p></p>Daniel Defoe was born Daniel Foe in London in 1660. It was perhaps, ineveitable that Defoe, an outspoken man, would become a political journalist. As a Puritan he believed God had given him a mission to print the truth, that is, to proselytize on religion and politics, and in fact, he became a prolific pamphleteer satirizing the hypocrisies of both Church and State. Defoe admired William III, and his poem <i>The True-Born Englishman </i>(1701) won him the King's friendship. But an ill-timed satire on High Church extremists, The Shortest Way with the Dissenters, published during Queen Anne's reign, resulted in his being pilloried and imprisoned for seditious libel in 1703. <br><br>At fifty-nine Defoe turned to fiction, completing <i>The Life and Strange Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe</i><b> </b>(1719), partly based on the saga of Alexander Selkirk, a Scottish sailor; <b>Moll Flanders</b> (1722); <i>Colonel Jack</i> (1722); <i>A Journal of the Plague Years<b> </b></i>(1722); and <i>Roxana or the Fortunate Mistress</i> (1724).</p><h2>Illuminated Initials in Full Color: 548 Designs (Dover Pictorial Archive)</h2><p>Among the glories of extant medieval manuscripts are the splendid illuminated initials in which geometric, curvilinear, animal, religious and other motifs intertwine to form extraordinarily beautiful and decorative letters.<br>For this striking volume, Carol Belanger Grafton has selected 548 illuminated letters-alphabetically arranged-from 19th-century reprints of medieval manuscripts.

(Harvey Cox)</p><h2>Butabu: Adobe Architecture of West Africa</h2><p>Many think that sub-Saharan African architecture is little more than mud huts. Mud, yes--but certainly not huts. Instead, these adobe buildings, many of them enormous, show sublime sculptural beauty, variety, ingenuity, and originality. In the Sahal region of western Africa--Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Togo, Benin, Ghana, and Burkina Faso--people have been constructing earthen buildings for centuries. But they remain unknown to most of the Western world. Their plastic forms--from simple stairways, to ornamented domes, to complex arches--are highlighted by subtle painting and intricate grillwork.<br>James Morris spent four months photographing these hidden jewels, from the great mosque at Djenne--the largest mud building in the world--to small houses in remote animist communities. <i>Butabu</i> shows these works as both aesthetic treasures and as architecture with contemporary relevance. These are no museum pieces, but rather buildings that continue to be maintained and built, even as they are threatened by the uncertainties of weather and the encroachment of Western technology. <br>Text by Suzanne Preston Blier covers the history of earthen architecture, the technology that creates it, and the symbolism of its form.</p><p>Suzanne Preston Blier is Professor of African Art and Architecture, Harvard University....hauntingly beautiful. -- <i>Icon, March 2004</i><br><br>...the dun, buff and biege of BUTABU...is a revelation. -- <i>New York Newsday, November 11, 2003</i><br><br>A beautiful and finely printed book...It is a handsome and scholarly addition to the literature on adobe architecture. -- <i>The Irish Catholic, 10/27/05</i><br><br>James Morris easily takes the palm for the year's most haunting architectural images...breathtaking. -- <i>The New York Times Book Review, December 7, 2003</i><br><br>James's photographs map out that rare experience, a journey into entirely unknown architectural territory. -- <i>The World of Interiors, December 2003</i><br><br>This might be the most important book on vernacular architecture since Bernard Rudofsky's 1964 Architecture Without Architects. -- <i>The Architects Newspaper, December 8, 2003</i></p><h2>Phonemic Awareness Activities for Early Reading Success (Grades K-2)</h2><p>Phonemic awareness&#x2014;the understanding that words are made up of sounds&#x2014;is essential to a child's early reading success. With this book, children gain this awareness through activities that are easy to teach and engaging. Children play with sounds through songs, rhymes, poetry, picture games, and other exercises. The activities cover the five basic levels of phonemic awareness:<p>ï¿½ the ability to hear rhymes and alliteration;</p><p>ï¿½ to do oddity tasks;</p><p>ï¿½ to orally blend word and split syllables;</p><p>ï¿½ to orally segment words;</p><p>ï¿½ to do phonemic manipulation tasks.</p><p>Blends critical reading skills with joyful word play.

Furthermore, it relates the chemical concepts that scaffold the biology of biochemistry, providing practical knowledge as well as many problem-solving opportunities to hone skills. Key Concepts and Concept Review features help students to identify and review important takeaways in each section.</p><p><p><b>LESS EXPENSIVE ... MORE CONVENIENT!</b> </p><ul> <li><b><i>Save money compare with new/used!</i></b></li> <li><b><i>Carry only what you need</i></b></li> <li><b><i>Keep everything in one place</i></b></li> </ul> <p>The images on the cover represent the scope of modern biochemistry, which seeks to characterize the molecules and reactions of life. In all organisms, genetic information in the form of a sequence of nucleotides in DNA is selectively expressed, as shown by the lighted spots of the DNA microarray in the background. Genetic information directs the synthesis of proteins. Each protein has a unique shape that can be visualized in three dimensions, as depicted by the blue surface model, and also has a unique metabolic function. For example, the protein shown on the cover is an enzyme whose activity contributes to the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells. Biochemists build on their knowledge of molecular structure and function to design compounds that can selectively interact with proteins in order to modulate their behavior. In this example (discussed in Box 10-B on page 280), the drug imatinib is shown as a green shape that fits snugly into the active site of the enzyme, blocking its activity and thereby inhibiting cancer growth. </p><p>Appreciating the structures and functions of biological molecules requires more than looking at pictures or reading about them. This book is designed not only to present information but also to help students develop the ability to answer questions, creating opportunities for them to explore and discover all aspects of biochemistry.</p></p><h2>The Crowd in the French Revolution</h2><p>What kinds of people were in the crowds that stormed the Bastille, marched to Versailles to bring the king and queen back to Paris, overthrew the monarchy in August 1792, or impassively witnessed the downfall of Robespierre on 9 Thermidor? Who led these crowds or mobilized them to action? What did they hope to achieve, and how far were their aims realized? Earlier historians have tended to view the revolutionary crowd as an abstraction--"people" or "mob" according to the writer's prejudice--often even as the personification of good or evil. Professor Rudï¿½'s book, published originally in 1959, makes a first attempt to bring objectively to life each of the important Parisian crowds between 1787 and 1795. Using police records and other contemporary research materials, the author identifies the social groups represented in them, contrasts the crowds with their political leaders, relates their activities to underlying economic and psychological tensions, and compares the Parisian crowd "patterns" to those of other popular movements in France and Britain during the 18th and early 19th centuries.<br></p><p>George Rude was a British Marxist historian, (1910-1993) specializing in the French Revolution and &#34;history from below,&#34; especially the importance of crowds in history."Dr. Rude holds the reader's interest by a masterly handling of a mass of material, and by making the Parisian crowds live again."--Times Literary Supplement<br><br>"An important contribution to the history of the Revolution."--E.J. Hobsbawm, New Statesman<br><br>"We should be grateful for the book; there is nothing quite like it."--American Historical Review</p><h2>Totally Random: Why Nobody Understands Quantum Mechanics (A Serious Comic on Entanglement)</h2><p><p><b>An eccentric comic about the central mystery of quantum mechanics</b></p><p><i>Totally Random</i> is a comic for the serious reader who wants to really understand the central mystery of quantum mechanics--entanglement: what it is, what it means, and what you can do with it.</p><p>Measure two entangled particles separately, and the outcomes are totally random. But compare the outcomes, and the particles seem as if they are instantaneously influencing each other at a distance&#x2015;even if they are light-years apart. This, in a nutshell, is entanglement, and if it seems weird, then this book is for you. <i>Totally Random</i> is a graphic experiential narrative that unpacks the deep and insidious significance of the curious correlation between entangled particles to deliver a gut-feel glimpse of a world that is not what it seems. See for yourself how entanglement has led some of the greatest thinkers of our time to talk about crazy-sounding stuff like faster-than-light signaling, many worlds, and cats that are both dead and alive. Find out why it remains one of science's most paradigm-shaking discoveries. Join Niels Bohr's therapy session with the likes of Einstein, Schrï¿½dinger, and other luminaries and let go of your commonsense notion of how the world works. Use your new understanding of entanglement to do the seemingly impossible, like beat the odds in the quantum casino, or quantum encrypt a message to evade the Sphinx's all-seeing eye. But look out, or you might just get teleported back to the beginning of the book!</p><p>A fresh and subversive look at our quantum world with some seriously funny stuff, <i>Totally Random</i> delivers a real understanding of entanglement that will completely change the way you think about the nature of physical reality.</p></p><p><p> "What a delight! <i>Totally Random</i> explores some of the strangest features of quantum theory--and introduces some of the most important new devices that exploit quantum weirdness--in a way that is accessible, smart, and funny.

He spent time as a school teacher after attending Harvard College but was dismissed for his refusal to administer corporal punishment. In 1845, wanting to write his first book, he moved to Walden Pond and built his cabin on land owned by Ralph Waldo Emerson. It was during his time at Walden that Thoreau was imprisoned briefly for not paying taxes; this experience became the basis for his well-known essay "Civil Disobedience." He died of tuberculosis in 1862 at the age of 44.</p></p><h2>Introduction to Kinesiology: Studying Physical Activity, Third Edition</h2><p><p><i>Introduction to Kinesiology: Studying Physical Activity, Third Edition</i>, explains the evolving discipline of kinesiology, demonstrating how its many subject areas integrate into a unified body of knowledge.

Clearly the natural movers, shakers, and leaders of this world, they can accomplish anything they set their minds to. They&#39;re the high achievers, the benchmark-setters, the business moguls, the concert violinists, the heads of the PTA. But if they&#39;re out of balance, they can be overly perfectionistic, driven, and critical. They can become controllers (everything has to go their way) or pleasers (exhausting themselves in meeting the demands of others). In The Firstborn Advantage, bestselling author, humorist, and internationally known psychologist Dr. Kevin Leman identifies the qualities of firstborns...and there&#39;s a hook. Just because you&#39;re the firstborn child in the family doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll have a firstborn personality. You can be #3 in a group of 4 siblings, and still have a firstborn personality! Dr. Leman reveals why.

A rebellious, hurt, and literally scarred teenager, she sets out to search for her birth family, her mother, and herself. Finding her way to the remote region where she was born, Angel reencounters the brittle cold world where her ancestors have withstood both the harsh dangers of nature and the incursion of hostile outsiders. Here she reunites with Agnes, her great-grandmother; Dora-Rouge, her great-great-grandmother; and Bush, the woman who adopted Angel's mother and raised Angel when she was a young girl.<br>But before Angel can settle into her new home, this recently rejoined family of women sets off by canoe on a journey to their ancestral homeland in the far North, where a hydroelectric dam project is under way. There Angel finds herself caught in a conflict that threatens two indigenous tribes, their ties to the land, and Angel's very essence as she tries to resolve her inner turmoil over who she is and where she belongs.<br>Robust and poetic, Solar Storms has the feel of a richly woven tapestry. Both as a story of love and family, and as a parable of the Native American quest to reclaim a lost way of life, the novel not only fulfills the enormous expectations raised by Linda Hogan's previous work, it surpasses it.</p><p>Linda Hogan is a professor at the University of Colorado.In her luminous, quietly compelling second novel, Hogan, a Chickasaw poet and writer (whose first novel, Mean Spirit, was a finalist for the Pulitzer), ties a young woman's coming-of-age to the fate of the natural world she comes to inhabit. Angela Jensen, a troubled 17-year-old, narrates the tale of her return to Adam's Rib, an island town in the boundary waters between Minnesota and Canada. Tucked into a pristine landscape of countless islands, wild animals and desperately harsh winters, it's her Native American family's homeland. As a child, Angela was abandoned by her mother, Hannah Wing, but not before Hannah had permanently scarred half of Angela's face; earlier, Hannah herself had been separated from her family and unspeakably abused. In Adam's Rib, Angela is reunited with her great-grandmother, Agnes Iron, and Agnes's mother, Dora-Rouge; she also spends a winter with Bush, a solitary woman who briefly raised her and, years earlier and also briefly, raised Hannah. Just as Angela discovers through her family's elemental way of life her own blood ties to the land, the threat of a huge hydroelectric dam project ruins her idyll. The four women?Angela, Agnes, Dora-Rouge and Bush?embark on a dangerous journey far northward to visit the homeland, where Hannah Wing is known to live. Hogan's finely tuned descriptions of the land and its spiritual significance draw a parallel between the ravages suffered by the environment and those suffered by Angela's mother. And, as the land is transformed, so are the lives of the characters, often in deeply resonant ways. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ulysses</h2><p>James Joyce adapted the structure of one of history&#39;s oldest and most familiar stories to his tale of Leopold Bloom&#39;s one-day odyssey through Dublin to produce a landmark in 20th-century literature. Evoking in rich, sensory details the streets, pubs, brothels, and shops of Dublin, focusing on seemingly insignificant detail, &#34;Ulysses&#34; is a triumphant celebration of an ordinary man. 4 cassettes.</p><p><i>Ulysses</i> has been labeled dirty, blasphemous, and unreadable. In a famous 1933 court decision, Judge John M. Woolsey declared it an emetic book--although he found it sufficiently unobscene to allow its importation into the United States--and Virginia Woolf was moved to decry James Joyce's "cloacal obsession." None of these adjectives, however, do the slightest justice to the novel. To this day it remains <i>the</i> modernist masterpiece, in which the author takes both Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. It is funny, sorrowful, and even (in a close-focus sort of way) suspenseful. And despite the exegetical industry that has sprung up in the last 75 years, <i>Ulysses</i> is also a compulsively readable book. Even the verbal vaudeville of the final chapters can be navigated with relative ease, as long as you're willing to be buffeted, tickled, challenged, and (occasionally) vexed by Joyce's sheer command of the English language.<p> Among other things, a novel is simply a long story, and the first question about any story is: <i>What happens?</i>. In the case of <i>Ulysses</i>, the answer might be <i>Everything</i>. William Blake, one of literature's sublime myopics, saw the universe in a grain of sand. Joyce saw it in Dublin, Ireland, on June 16, 1904, a day distinguished by its utter normality. Two characters, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, go about their separate business, crossing paths with a gallery of indelible Dubliners. We watch them teach, eat, stroll the streets, argue, and (in Bloom's case) masturbate. And thanks to the book's stream-of-consciousness technique--which suggests no mere stream but an impossibly deep, swift-running river--we're privy to their thoughts, emotions, and memories. The result? Almost every variety of human experience is crammed into the accordian folds of a single day, which makes <i>Ulysses</i> not just an experimental work but the very last word in realism. </p><p> Both characters add their glorious intonations to the music of Joyce's prose. Dedalus's accent--that of a freelance aesthetician, who dabbles here and there in what we might call Early Yeats Lite--will be familiar to readers of <i>Portrait of an Artist As a Young Man</i>. But Bloom's wistful sensualism (and naive curiosity) is something else entirely. Seen through his eyes, a rundown corner of a Dublin graveyard is a figure for hope and hopelessness, mortality and dogged survival: "Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody really?" --<i>James Marcus</i></p>The 1934 text, as corrected and reset in 1961. Ulysses is one of the most influential novels of the twentieth century. It was not easy to find a publisher in America willing to take it on, and when Jane Jeap and Margaret Anderson started printing extracts from the book their literary magazine The Little Review in 1918, they were arrested and charged with publishing obscenity. They were fined $100, and even The New York Times expressed satisfaction with their conviction. Ulysses was not published in book form until 1922, when another American woman, Sylvia Beach, published it in Paris for her Shakespeare &amp; Company. Ulysses was not available legally in any English-speaking country until 1934, when Random House successfully defended Joyce against obscenity charges and published it in the Modern Library. This edition follows the complete and unabridged text as corrected and reset in 1961. Judge John Woolsey's decision lifting the ban against Ulysses is reprinted, along with a letter from Joyce to Bennett Cerf, the publisher of Random House, and the original foreword to the book by Morris L. Ernst, who defended Ulysses during the trial.</p><h2>The Mexican Keto Cookbook: Authentic, Big-Flavor Recipes for Health and Longevity</h2><p><b>Containing more than 100 low-carb, high-fat, anti-inflammatory recipes, <i>The Mexican Keto Cookbook </i>provides insight into the history of Mexican cuisine while also adding a flavorful, international flair to the popular keto diet.</b><br><br>In contrast to the typical Mexican American diet--the result of busy schedules, tight budgets, and high-sugar, white flour foods of convenience--<i> The Mexican Keto Cookbook</i> is packed with authentic, full-flavored, health-conscious recipes designed to burn body fat. It includes the science behind keto, guides you on how to execute the diet effectively, and provides more than 100 amazing recipes. Integrative holistic nutritionist Torie Borrelli tapped into her Mexican heritage to create keto-friendly staples of Mexican cuisine such as Salsa Bandera, Nopales Salad, and Sopa de Albondigas; quick and easy weeknight dinners such as Chicken Tortilla Soup, Goat Cheese Enchiladas, and Spicy Cilantro Chicken Wings; and hearty crowd-pleasers such as Fish Tacos and Turmeric Caper Cauliflower. With this very first low-carb, anti-inflammatory, high-fat Mexican ketogenic cookbook on hand, you can enjoy all the fun and flavor of your favorite Mexican foods while reaping the many health, weight loss, and other benefits keto has to offer.</p><p>TORIE BORRELLI is an integrative holistic nutritionist, wellness consultant, recipe creator, and founder of The Vida Well, a brand rooted in nutrition education and wholesome living. Her Mexican and Italian heritage birthed a lifelong love of food, but personal health issues were ultimately the impetus behind Torie&#39;s pursuit of an education in holistic medicine and nutritional cooking. Borrelli is an instructor at Rancho La Puerta Health Spa in Tecate, Mexico, and a collaborator with brands such as Butcher Box, Bulletproof, Siete Foods, Lyft, Kopari, and Coola.INTRODUCTION<br><br> MY JOURNEY TO HEALTH<br><br> I discovered the keto-focused, anti-inflammatory lifestyle after struggling with my health for twenty-five years. When I was sixteen, I was diagnosed with celiac disease, Hashimoto&#x2019;s thyroiditis, and irritable bowel syndrome (or IBS), which I thankfully do not have today. While my daily work as an integrative holistic nutritionist includes helping people with everything from weight loss to diabetes, I have faced my own set of health issues over the years. About four years ago, I experienced a radical shift in my personal health that has led me to writing this book today.<br><br> My journey to finding health through nutrition has been an incredibly transformative one. I spent years trying the newest fad diets, every health trend under the sun, and the most punishing cleanses before I found something that worked for me. My goal for this book is to cut through all the confusing, conflicting health information and tell you everything you need to nourish your body. Cooking healthy meals with the right ingredients should be fun and inspiring&#x2014;not a chore or intimidating.<br><br>Transitioning to a high-fat lifestyle has been one of the most impactful changes in my life. Before this, I was constantly &#x201c;stabilizing my blood sugar&#x201d; by eating every couple of hours to relieve my hanger. Switching to a high-fat ketogenic diet cleared my brain fog, energized me, and eliminated hunger pangs and mood swings from my life. Fat doesn&#x2019;t make you fat; it makes you thrive. After applying these principles to my own life and seeing dramatic changes, I started to implement them with my clients, friends, and anyone who wanted to let me guide them.<br><br> THE HEALING TRANSITION<br> Before I launched my brand, The Vida Well, in 2016, I worked closely with leading naturopaths, chiropractors, acupuncturists, and local San Diego doctors. I helped develop personalized programs for their patients combating everything from daily concerns such as fatigue and skin issues to widespread chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. This work inspired me to create The Vida Well, a wellness and education brand rooted in health and nutrition. I created this platform to open people&#x2019;s worlds by helping them take a preventative approach to living, which essentially means not waiting until sickness strikes in order to change habits. My work consists of meeting one-on-one with clients, corporate consulting, and teaching around the world.<br><br> The knowledge I had, along with the direct access to some of San Diego&#x2019;s best practitioners, helped me give patients the tools to change their lives through diet. And with this book, I can help so many more people than I would ever be able to on a one-on-one basis.<br><br> Throughout my work with thousands of clients, one thing has made itself clear to me: people are confused. There is an overwhelming amount of misinformation out there when it comes to what we should be eating. My clients will often share, with increasing exasperation and frustration, things they read online. They&#x2019;re hesitant to eat fat because they believe it will clog their arteries, and they&#x2019;re worried that skipping breakfast or snacks will cause a drop in blood sugar.<br><br> This book will dispel all the ambiguity by breaking down the science of nutrition into easily digestible information and giving you clear solutions to help eliminate sugar and reduce carbohydrates in your diet. Everyone I have worked with, no matter what symptoms they have, has benefited from this simple process.<br><br> I will not recommend anything in this book that I have not experimented with on myself. For so long, I felt like I tried everything from going gluten-free to using prescription medications. The major shift happened when my mind felt clear and I was satisfied after meals. With the keto diet, I have finally found something that not only works but is a tenable way to live.<br><br> THE TRUTH<br>Chronic inflammatory diseases have never been more of a global problem than they are right now. Most of this is due to inflammation caused by poor nutritional habits, stress levels, sedentary lifestyles, abnormal sleep patterns, and environmental exposures. As our food becomes more sugar laden and processed, the number of people suffering with inflammation-based diseases&nbsp;such as diabetes, fatty liver disease, mental illnesses, digestive disorders, and even cancer continues to rise. The United States spends more on health care than any other country, yet our rates of disease are the highest in the world. Over half of the country is suffering from ailments that can be treated, managed, or even reversed through nutrition-based programs. My own experiences have inspired me to look for answers, but the positive change I see in my clients has turned it into my passion.<br><br> THE SOLUTION<br> The good news is that this doesn&#x2019;t have to be the way. We can go back to a more intuitive way of eating and still live in the modern world. Pairing locally sourced and unprocessed foods with my simple high-fat, low-carb guidelines will transform the way your body functions and, with that, many aspects of your health.<br><br> I chose to focus on Mexican food for a couple reasons. I&#x2019;m half Mexican and live&nbsp;in Mexico part-time, so Mexican cooking is like a first language to me. Traditional Mexican cuisine is high in healthy fats and proteins and lends itself well to a ketogenic diet. Finally, many of my clients have some sort of Mexican heritage like I do. Seeing people embrace their culinary roots firsthand and at the same time reverse their inflammation symptoms is one of the best parts of my job.<br><br> In researching the concept for this book, I started to explore the ways my great-grandparents ate and their relationship with food. What I discovered was that not too long ago, their diet closely resembled the one I have painstakingly discovered through trial and error. Slow-cooked meats, whole fish, and seasonal vegetables served with homemade salsas comprised the majority of their meals. You&#x2019;ll read more about the relationship between high-fat foods and Mexican cooking on page 8.<br><br> Everyone wants to lead healthier lives, but most are overwhelmed by either nutrition myths or inflammation ailments or both. Throughout this book, you will learn simple ways to prioritize your everyday health. This cookbook is your road map to wellness. You will learn that food reminiscent of abuelita&#x2019;s cooking is healthier than any commercialized Mexican food you&#x2019;ll find today. These flavorful Mexican recipes will resemble what people ate before processed and fast foods became the norm in both Mexico and the United States.<br><br> My goal is to educate and empower by taking the traditional Mexican dishes I have always known and loved and updating them to optimize health in a delicious and enjoyable way. Each recipe will be accompanied by health tips, ingredient facts, and substitution ideas. I will also help you fill your kitchen cabinets with affordable and nutrient-dense staples. We want to create an enduring lifestyle change rather than a quick fix. It&#x2019;s time to become more connected with the food we put into our bodies and learn to listen to our bodies&#x2019; signals.<br><br> Imagine a life where you have the energy to check things off your always growing to-do list, where you&#x2019;re sleeping through the night, not wearing as much makeup because your skin is now clear and glowing, where you&#x2019;re fitting into that favorite pair of jeans, and feeling like your best self. You slow down, listen, and understand the messages from your body.<br><br> Of course, there isn&#x2019;t a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to nutrition. Everyone has their own taste preferences and health issues. Still, despite these distinctions, everybody can benefit from incorporating keto concepts into their life. All the research I have done, all my experiences working with people to better their nutrition, and my own personal journey with the keto diet have shown me that proactively reducing your inflammation leads to major health benefits. Imbalance is caused by inflammation. Just one imbalance creates oxidative stress in the body, which in turn creates mitochondrial dysfunction. Inflammation is something that every single one of us has, although the symptoms may present themselves in different ways.<br><br> These simple and straightforward recipes are low in carbs, high in healthy fats, and moderate in protein. This book uses the principles of the ketogenic diet (see page 16) and the pillars of Mexican heritage cuisine as the foundation for creating affordable and accessible meals that will reduce disease-causing inflammation in the body, speed up your metabolism, help shed those extra pounds, clear that brain fog, improve mental clarity, and balance your hormones.<br><br> It can be argued that everybody loves Mexican food&#x2014;but that&#x2019;s not why I&#x2019;m writing this book. People all over the world are sick and they are only getting sicker. There are so many conflicting opinions about what is healthy, and people fall into a mainstream-trending diet hole. They are afraid to include fat in their diets, opting for low-fat, high-sugar, and high-chemical products instead. Most people don&#x2019;t have easy access to nutrient-rich food, elite dieting fads, or posh cookbooks. My hope is that this book will start to bridge that chasm by bringing this information to people all over the world.</p><h2>Official CPC Certification 2019 - Study Guide</h2><p>AAPC&#39;s Official CPCï¿½ Certification Study guide is specifically designed to help individuals prepare for the CPCï¿½ exam.

Poet Simon Ortiz had honored those people seventeen years earlier in his own way. That book, <i>from Sand Creek</i>, is now back in print.<br><br> Originally published in a small-press edition, <i>from Sand Creek</i> makes a large statement about injustices done to Native peoples in the name of Manifest Destiny. It also makes poignant reference to the spread of that ambition in other parts of the world&#x2014;notably in Vietnam&#x2014;as Ortiz asks himself what it is to be an American, a U.S. citizen, and an Indian. Indian people have often felt they have had no part in history, Ortiz observes, and through his work he shows how they can come to terms with this feeling. He invites Indian people to examine the process they have experienced as victims, subjects, and expendable resources&#x2014;and asks people of European heritage to consider the motives that drive their own history and create their own form of victimization.<br><br> Through the pages of this sobering work, Ortiz offers a new perspective on history and on America. Perhaps more important, he offers a breath of hope that our peoples might learn from each other:<br><br><i>This America<br> has been a burden<br> of steel and mad<br> death,<br> but, look now,<br> there are flowers<br> and new grass<br> and a spring wind<br> rising<br> from Sand Creek.</i></p><p>Poet, fiction writer, essayist, and storyteller Simon Ortiz is a native of Acoma Pueblo and is the author of numerous books."One of the classic books of Native American poetry . . .

Vadim is a Russian ï¿½migrï¿½ who, like Nabokov, is a novelist, poet and critic. There are threads linking the fictional hero with his creator as he reconstructs the images of his past from young love to his serious illness.</p><p>Focusing on the central figures of his life--his four wives, his books, and his muse, Dementia--the book leads us to suspect that the fictions Vadim has created as an author have crossed the line between his life&#39;s work and his life itself, as the worlds of reality and literary invention grow increasingly indistinguishable.<b>Vladimir Nabokov</b> was born on April 23, 1899, in St. Petersburg, Russia. The Nabokovs were known for their high culture and commitment to public service, and the elder Nabokov was an outspoken opponent of anti-Semitism and one of the leaders of the opposition party, the Kadets. In 1919, following the Bolshevik Revolution, he took his family into exile. Four years later he was shot and killed at a political rally in Berlin while trying to shield the speaker from right-wing assassins.&nbsp; The Nabokov household was trilingual, and as a child Nabokov was already reading Wells, Poe, Browning, Keats, Flaubert, Verlaine, Rimbaud, Tolstoy, and Chekhov alongside the popular entertainments of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Jules Verne. As a young man, he studied Slavic and romance languages at Trinity College, Cambridge, taking his honors degree in 1922. For the next&nbsp;18 years he lived in Berlin and Paris, writing prolifically in Russian under the pseudonym "Sirin" and supporting himself through translations, lessons in English and tennis, and by composing the first crossword puzzles in Russian. In 1925, he married Vera Slonim, with whom he had one child, a son, Dmitri.&nbsp; Having already fled Russia and Germany, Nabokov became a refugee once more in 1940, when he was forced to leave France for the United States. There he taught at Wellesley, Harvard, and Cornell. He also gave up writing in Russian and began composing fiction in English. His most notable works include <i>Bend Sinister&nbsp;</i>(1947),&nbsp;<i>Lolita</i>&nbsp;(1955),&nbsp;<i>Pnin</i>&nbsp;(1957), and&nbsp;<i>Pale Fire</i>&nbsp;(1962), as well as the translation of his earlier Russian novels into English. He also undertook English translations of works by Lermontov and Pushkin and wrote several books of criticism. Vladimir Nabokov died in Montreux, Switzerland, in 1977.</p><h2>Math in Focus: Singapore Math: Homeschool Answer Key Grade 5</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

With the addition of 105 species, the book now contains information on 462 of the most common wildflower species found in the state's major vegetation zones -- from the mountains in the west to the swamplands in the east, from desert to piney woods to coastal plain, from the Panhandle to the semitropical Rio Grande Valley. Each entry reflects the most current scientific knowledge about the plant, such as recent changes in taxonomic classification.<p> Designed for ease of use in the field, the guide is organized by color -- the most obvious characteristic of flowers. The species are thus grouped into four sections: white-green, yellow-orange, red-pink, and blue-purple. Within each color section the species are arranged alphabetically by family, then genus and species. Information about each species includes its bloom period, range and habitat, botanical description, and other helpful facts. A special note in each entry explains the plant's therapeutic, culinary, or other traditional uses as well as its landscaping value. Alternate common names and the origin and meaning of the plant's scientific name are also provided, giving readers insight into the rich history and lore of botany.</p><p> To simplify the identification of wildflower species in the field, a full-color photograph of each flower appears on the page facing the entry.

All ages.</p><p>Gustave Dore's magnificent engravings for <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i> are among the later works of the great French illustrator. The intensely evocative poem provided Dorï¿½ with the long-awaited opportunity to convey limitless space on a gigantic scale, and he exploited the poem's fantastic range of atmosphere to the limits of its possibilities. The terrifying space of the open sea, the storms and whirlpools of an unknown ocean, the vast icy caverns of Antarctica, the hot equatorial sea swarming with monsters, all of the amazing visual elements that make Coleridge's masterpiece one of the most exciting and most memorable poems in the English language are unforgettably engraved in Dorï¿½'s plates.<br>This edition reproduces all of the plates to perfection, in their original size. The illustrations and the text of the poem appear on facing pages, so that the imaginative kinship of Dorï¿½ and Coleridge is delightfully evident on every page: the illustrations capture all the moods of the poem in their full intensity, bringing the images evoked by the words into clear visual focus.<br>Unabridged and slightly rearranged republication of the 1878 American edition.

Raffel casts the novel in an English idiom that--had Voltaire been a twenty-first-century American--he might himself have employed. The translation is immediate and unencumbered, and for the first time makes Voltaire the <i>satirist a </i>wicked pleasure for English-speaking readers.<br><br><i>Candide</i> recounts the fantastically improbable travels, adventures, and misfortunes of the young Candide, his beloved Cunï¿½gonde, and his devoutly optimistic tutor, Pangloss. Endowed at the start with good fortune and every prospect for happiness and success, the characters nevertheless encounter every conceivable misfortune. Voltaire&#x2019;s philosophical tale, in part an ironic attack on the optimistic thinking of such figures as G. W. Leibniz and Alexander Pope, has proved enormously influential over the years. In a general introduction to this volume, historian Johnson Kent Wright places <i>Candide in </i>the contexts of Voltaire&#x2019;s life and work and the Age of Enlightenment.</p></p><p>Political satire doesn't age well, but occasionally a diatribe contains enough art and universal mirth to survive long after its timeliness has passed. <i>Candide</i> is such a book. Penned by that Renaissance man of the Enlightenment, Voltaire, <i>Candide</i> is steeped in the political and philosophical controversies of the 1750s. But for the general reader, the novel's driving principle is clear enough: the idea (endemic in Voltaire's day) that we live in the best of all possible worlds, and apparent folly, misery and strife are actually harbingers of a greater good we cannot perceive, is hogwash.<p> Telling the tale of the good-natured but star-crossed Candide (think Mr. Magoo armed with deadly force), as he travels the world struggling to be reunited with his love, Lady Cunegonde, the novel smashes such ill-conceived optimism to splinters. Candide's tutor, Dr. Pangloss, is steadfast in his philosophical good cheer, in the face of more and more fantastic misfortune; Candide's other companions always supply good sense in the nick of time. Still, as he demolishes optimism, Voltaire pays tribute to human resilience, and in doing so gives the book a pleasant indomitability common to farce. Says one character, a princess turned one-buttocked hag by unkind Fate: "I have wanted to kill myself a hundred times, but somehow I am still in love with life. This ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of our most melancholy propensities; for is there anything more stupid than to be eager to go on carrying a burden which one would gladly throw away, to loathe one's very being and yet to hold it fast, to fondle the snake that devours us until it has eaten our hearts away?"<i>--Michael Gerber</i></p><p>In this new translation of Voltaire&#x2019;s best-known work, distinguished translator Burton Raffel captures the irreverent spirit of <i>Candide and </i>renders the novel in clear, vivacious English. Stylistically superior to all predecessors, Raffel&#x2019;s version now stands as the translation of choice for twenty-first-century readers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Conundrum: An Extraordinary Narrative of Transsexualism</h2><p>Drawing upon her own experiences, the distinguished English writer candidly discusses the phychological and physiological aspects of undergoing a sex change</p><p>"This is a beautiful book.&nbsp; I found it to be melancholic, courageous, and wise.&nbsp; That it's subject matter is Jan Morris's transsexual journey almost seems secondary to&nbsp;her incredible prose and the clarity of her honesty and introspection.&nbsp; Beyond the issue of gender, she&nbsp;searches for an answer&nbsp;to that most elusive of questions: who am I?" -- Jonathan AmesJan Morris was born in 1926 of a Welsh father and an English mother, and when she is not travelling she lives with her partner Elizabeth Morris in the top left-hand corner of Wales, between the mountains and the sea.

Do it right, and no one notices. Do it wrong, and your film or video sounds messy, distracting, and unrealistic. This is a book for people who need to edit production sound for film, TV, or video but were never taught how to do it. It goes step by step through the process and covers all the workflows you are likely to encounter. Efficient working practices are emphasized throughout, so you learn to save time and avoid needless repetition.<br><br>Many dialogue editors are hobbled by a lack of understanding of the non-sound aspects of filmmaking. Unlike editors who cut effects, backgrounds or Foley, a dialogue editor's work is directly affected by what has gone on before. How a film was shot, recorded and edited will dramatically influence the dialogue editing process. Much of this book, then, deals with things which at first glance don't appear to be dialogue. You will find overviews of film picture and sound postproduction--film, tape, NTSC, PAL, 24p, and HD. There are summaries of film picture editing, OMF manipulation, and ADR management. <br><br>* A veteran sound editor shows you how to produce a flawless dialogue track<br>* Covers organization and time management so you can work efficiently<br>* Must-have information for sound editors, dialogue editors, and assistant editors<br>* Foreword by Dominick Tavella, who mixes films in New York (some of his films include: Chocolat, Far and Away, Vanity Fair, and Chicago)</p><p>An Emmy award-winning sound editor based in Tel Aviv, John Purcell has decades of experience in film, video, and sound editing in the US, Europe, and Middle East.

I have not previously seen a book that has realistically dealt with the professional responsibilities of a dialog editor. Dialog is the focus of a successful soundtrack. It not only contains the majority of the intellectual arch of the film but the timbers and tempos of the actor's voices are instrumental in establishing the critical relationship between the audience and the viewer. Without the Dialog editor's well-prepared session it is difficult and costly, (in terms of time spent in the dub) if not impossible, for the mixer to do what is necessary to establish or enhance that relationship.

In this moving, inspirational account, the twenty-seven-year- old widowed mother of a six-year-old girl shares for the first time the little-known details of her traumatic ordeal and expands on how her faith and the bestselling book The Purpose-DrivenLife helped her survive and bring the killer&#39;s murderous rampage to a peaceful end. Like her captor, Smith too has faced darkness and despair. Yet even during the most desolate times of her life, she yearned for something better. Seeking a new life, she moved to Atlanta, got a job, enrolled in a medical assistant training program, and was beginning to find her way to becoming the kind of mom she wanted her little girl to have. Then Brian Nichols took her hostage. Just hours earlier, he&#39;d allegedly shot to death a judge, a court reporter, a deputy, and a federal agent and escaped in a stolen vehicle. Ashley had paid only passing attention to media coverage of the unfolding manhunt. Now she found herself face-to-face with Nichols, a desperate, heavily armed man with nothing left to lose. Unlikely Angel is Ashley&#39;s gripping, powerful account of how this nightmare scenario developed into a remarkable connection between a man wanted for multiple murders and a single mother struggling to make a fresh beginning from her troubled past. Juxtaposing the minute-by-minute tale of her experience with the never-before-told tragedies and triumphs of her own life, Unlikely Angelis a story that will leave no reader untouched. Ashley has made appearances on Oprah, Good Morning America, 20/20, and Larry King Live.</p><p><p>Ashley Smith -- A native of Augusta, Georgia, Ashley lives with her family and six-year-old daughter, Paige, and is active in her church. Ashley believes that God led her through the dark hours with Nichols and that she is called to use the highly publicized experience to help people find their purpose. Ashley will devote some of the royalties she earns from this book to create a memorial that will serve as a permanent tribute to the victims.</p>Unlikely Angel Copyright 2005 by Paigeturner, Inc.

W I L L I A M M O R R O W A n I m p r i n t o f H a r p e r C o l l i n s P u b l i s h e r s 1hostage Friday, March 11, 2005 At 9:45 p.m. my cell phone rang. I looked down at my caller ID --- it was my step-dad calling from Augusta again. What could he want this time? &#39;What are you doing?&#39; he asked. I was exhausted, almost too tired to answer. I held the phone against my ear with my shoulder so I could carry a load of trash out of my second-floor apartment down to my car. I had been moving for two days. My new place was a smaller, bottom-level apartment on the other side of the complex. I didn&#39;t have much left to do here --- just some vacuuming and painting to return the place to its original condition. But I wasn&#39;t doing any of that tonight. I needed sleep. I was driving to Dacula in the morning to see Paige. &#39;I&#39;m moving the rest of my stuff,&#39; I said, trying to get down the stairs. Just please let me get off this phone. &#39;You&#39;re out? There&#39;s a man on the loose and you&#39;re out? Haven&#39;t you been watching the news like I told you?&#39; This was the second time my step-dad had called me about the guy on the news. The first time was late this morning when he woke me up calling. He kept talking about a man and shootings at the courthouse, and he told me to stay inside. I&#39;d been up all night unpacking boxes, and I just didn&#39;t understand his concern. I mean, I lived in Duluth, maybe half an hour northeast of downtown Atlanta. &#39;Thanks, but I&#39;m not too worried about it,&#39; I had told him. I learned a little more about the story when I went to work later in the day. I&#39;d just started a second job at Barnacle&#39;s, a restaurant maybe five minutes from my apartment complex. The news was playing on the TV screens when I got there, and I caught the basics: A man had killed some people at the Fulton County Courthouse and now he was on the run. My coworkers were talking about it a lot, but I didn&#39;t pay too much attention. Being from Augusta, I was used to hearing about violent crime in Atlanta. And I had a lot on my mind with the move anyway. &#39;Look,&#39; I said to my step-dad now as I shut my car door and headed back up to the apartment, &#39;this guy&#39;s not going to come after me. I mean, he could be anywhere.&#39; I thought back to the five police officers who had come into Barnacle&#39;s for dinner. I was training to work the door, and as the men were walking out, I heard someone ask them, &#39;Hey, have y&#39;all caught that guy yet?&#39; &#39;Oh, don&#39;t you worry about him,&#39; one officer said. &#39;He&#39;s probably in Alabama by now.&#39; I tried to reassure my step-dad: &#39;You know, an officer who came into the restaurant said the guy&#39;s probably in Alabama, so I&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;ve just gotten off work, and I have a few more things to get out of here. Then I&#39;m done. I&#39;ll be on my way to the other apartment in a few minutes. I promise.&#39; &#39;Well, okay,&#39; my step-dad said. &#39;Just get home and get inside and don&#39;t leave.&#39; &#39;Okay. Fine.&#39; I loaded the rest of the trash into my car and drove the half mile or so to the other side of the apartment complex. I was thinking about what the next day would look like. I would see Paige in the morning. My Aunt Kim, who had custody of her right now, had brought her the two and a half hours from Augusta, and they were staying with my Uncle David&#39;s family in Dacula, about thirty miles northeast of Atlanta toward Athens. We were all meeting up at Uncle David&#39;s church at ten o&#39;clock for a kids&#39; ministry Olympics day. Then I would work a day shift at Express in Gwinnett Place Mall and a night shift at Barnacle&#39;s. It would be a full day, and I felt completely shot right now. I knew I just had to get to bed. I couldn&#39;t let myself do any more unpacking tonight. Maybe one or two boxes, but that was it. Really, Ashley, you can&#39;t get sucked into this. I pulled up to my new apartment and parked right in front of the door. I didn&#39;t have far to carry my things, only ten or twelve steps up the walk. When I got inside, I pulled off my gray knit work shirt and black leather belt, which left me in a white tank top and a pair of baggy jeans. Then I turned on the TV in the living room. &#39;Okay,&#39; I said, looking at the five or six boxes lined up in the middle of the floor. &#39;Just one or two.&#39; While the news played in the background, I began unpacking the boxes and putting things where they belonged. The eight-by-ten photograph of Paige holding that red flower could go on top of my stereo speaker near the door. The two gold angel candleholders could sit on my picture table for now --- I was going to hang them on either side of that mirror propped up on the back of the sofa. Now and then as I worked I heard what the news anchors were saying: The man from the courthouse was still at large. He&#39;d killed three people. There was something about a green Honda. I didn&#39;t hear much. Mainly, I was focused on getting my house the way I liked it. I knew exactly where I wanted things --- photographs, candles, lamps, books, knickknacks --- and I just kept going. At about eleven I stopped and smoked a couple of cigarettes. I only had one left in the pack now, but I purposely had not gone by the store after work to buy any more because I knew I was going to make it an early night.</p><h2>50 Essays: A Portable Anthology</h2><p>By Samuel Cohen - Bedford/St. Martin&#39;s (2010) - Paperback - 560 pages - ISBN 0312609655 50 Essays: A Portable Anthology is the best-selling value-priced reader in the country because its virtues don&#39;t stop at the price.

Religion Makes Us Feel One with the Universe</h2><p><p>Why do some things pass under the radar of our attention, but other things capture our interest? Why do some religions catch on and others fade away? What makes a story, a movie, or a book riveting? Why do some people keep watching the news even though it makes them anxious?</p><p>The past 20 years have seen a remarkable flourishing of scientific research into exactly these kinds of questions. Professor Jim Davies' fascinating and highly accessible book, <i>Riveted</i>, reveals the evolutionary underpinnings of why we find things compelling, from art to religion and from sports to superstition. Compelling things fit our minds like keys in the ignition, turning us on and keeping us running, and yet we are often unaware of what makes these "keys" fit. What we like and don't like is almost always determined by subconscious forces, and when we try to consciously predict our own preferences we're often wrong. In one study of speed dating, people were asked what kinds of partners they found attractive. When the results came back, the participants' answers before the exercise had no correlation with who they actually found attractive in person! We are beginning to understand just how much the brain makes our decisions for us: we are rewarded with a rush of pleasure when we detect patterns, as the brain thinks we've discovered something significant; the mind urges us to linger on the news channel or rubberneck an accident in case it might pick up important survival information; it even pushes us to pick up <i>People </i>magazine in order to find out about changes in the social structure.</p><p>Drawing on work from philosophy, anthropology, religious studies, psychology, economics, computer science, and biology, Davies offers a comprehensive explanation to show that in spite of the differences between the many things that we find compelling, they have similar effects on our minds and brains.</p></p><p>Jim Davies is a professor at the Institute of Cognitive Science of Carleton University, and director of the Science of Imagination Laboratory. He has been featured in <i>Skeptic </i>and <i>Nautilus </i>magazines, and has presented at Pecha Kucha Ottawa and TEDx on his theories of imagination. He writes a <i>Psychology Today </i>blog called <i>The Science of Imagination</i>. He lives in Ottawa, Canada.<p>&#x201c;A fascinating analysis of what we find fascinating.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;Moments that jolt or delight us punctuate our lives. But whereas shock might be salutary in an art gallery, it can trigger blind belief in other contexts, points out cognitive scientist Jim Davies. Expounding his theory of 'compellingness foundations', Davies synthesizes research on what makes us susceptible to gripping stimuli, such as our drives to discover patterns and to find incongruity, and our attraction to hope and fear. Scepticism, he argues, can help us to build resistance to riveting ideas that turn out to be duds.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Nature</i></p><p>&#x201c;Davies's book is not meant to be a "how-to" manual for artists. He's not sure it's even possible to engineer a work of art based on these principles of compellingness. What the book may do, he says, is help creatives "understand the basis of their intuitions." Riveted...presents a unified theory of compellingness.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Fast Company</i></p><p>&#x201c;In the battle to grab attention, you should heed the musings of Jim Davies in <i>Riveted</i>...Davies attempts a grand unified theory of compellingness...What [<i>Riveted</i>] show[s] is that while media culture can be overwhelming, it also provides a great platform from which to observe the endless mysteries and absurdities of human nature.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>New Scientist</i></p><p>&#x201c;To describe Riveted as riveting sounds clichï¿½, but I predict that Jim Davies could be the next Malcolm Gladwell. Integrating scientific findings with compelling stories across the wide spectrum of the human experience--art, music, literature, comedy, magic, quotes, sports, conspiracy theories, gossip, religion, and science itself--Davies weaves a central theme throughout to explain what makes them all so compelling. You can read Riveted for five minutes or five hours and be enriched at multiple levels, and the book itself explains why. How recursive.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Michael Shermer is the Publisher of Skeptic magazine, a monthly columnist for Scientific American, and the author of The Believing Brain, Why Darwin Matters, and The Science of Good and Evil</i></p><p>&#x201c;What makes a song, a piece of art, a tabloid or even a silly romantic comedy film trailer so enthralling? What is it about these things that draw us in, even when we may (or at least should) know better? In <i>Riveted</i>, Jim Davies tackles this complex question by proposing a thoughtful, interdisciplinary framework to illuminate the qualities of 'compellingness,' the very attributes of riveting things that have the power to sway our beliefs and attention. By tying together psychological, anthropological, cognitive science, and evolutionary biological studies, he provides a thorough and persuasive context to help us understand how the compelling can fascinate (and sometimes manipulate) the human mind.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kayt Sukel, author of Dirty Minds: How Our Brains Influence Love, Sex, and Relationships</i></p><p>&#x201c;My life's work as an experience designer has been to rivet audiences for Universal, Disney, Sanrio, Broadway as well as to train soldiers, surgeons, and other high-risk job holders for life and death situations. So I know how and what makes an audience &#x2018;riveted,' but not until reading Jim Davies' book did I understand WHY audiences are RIVETED. This book is a delightful read through the many diverse and nuanced drivers of human experience, influences, and choices. It is a must read for anyone who is looking to influence these strange beasts we call humans and keep them captivated.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Christopher Stapleton, Experience Designer and Creative Venture Catalyst, Simiosys</i></p><p>&#x201c;Accessible and entertaining. Davies draws fascinating insights from a wealth of diverse material.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jeanette Bicknell, Ph.D., author of Why Music Moves Us</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Riveted</i> lives up to its title as a compelling investigation into the properties of our lives, the origins of which can be traced to the kind of species we are: why we plan, imagine, invent imaginary worlds, weep and laugh in chorus, delight in puzzles and incongruities, respond to patterns, rhythms, and repetitions, cluster in groups and create outsiders, seek attractive partners, and crave status. To a better understanding of human nature, this book is a brilliant guide.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Donald Beecher, Chancellor's Professor, Carleton University, Ottawa</i></p></p><h2>Explaining Physics: GCSE Edition</h2><p>The perfect grounding for students intending to take their studies to a more advanced level, Explaining Physics contains all the essential concepts required by students studying Physics within any Key Stage 4 science course.<br><br>Explaining Physics emphasizes the applications and social effects of physics, and extends its treatment of energy and electronics.<br><br>DT Introductory page to each unit to bring out the relevance of the material to everyday life<br><br>DT Simple questions at the end of each unit to consolidate learning<br><br>DT Helpful revision summary</p><p>Stephen Pople is the author of many highly successful science books for children.

This provocative book exposes the dictator&#x2019;s preoccupation with his private persona, which was shaped by the aesthetic and ideological management of his domestic architecture. Hitler&#x2019;s bachelor life stirred rumors, and the Nazi regime relied on the dictator&#x2019;s three dwellings&#x2014;the Old Chancellery in Berlin, his apartment in Munich, and the Berghof, his mountain home on the Obersalzberg&#x2014;to foster the myth of the Fï¿½hrer as a morally upstanding and refined man. Author Despina Stratigakos also reveals the previously untold story of Hitler&#x2019;s interior designer, Gerdy Troost, through newly discovered archival sources.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the height of the Third Reich, media outlets around the world showcased Hitler&#x2019;s homes to audiences eager for behind-the-scenes stories. After the war, fascination with Hitler&#x2019;s domestic life continued as soldiers and journalists searched his dwellings for insights into his psychology. The book&#x2019;s rich illustrations, many previously unpublished, offer readers a rare glimpse into the decisions involved in the making of Hitler&#x2019;s homes and into the sheer power of the propaganda that influenced how the world saw him.</p><p>This revelatory history looks at the residences of Adolf Hitler, illuminating their powerful role in constructing and promoting the dictator&#x2019;s private persona both within Germany and abroad.<br><b>Despina Stratigakos </b>is professor of architecture at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York.</p><h2>Biosocial Criminology: A Primer</h2><p>This is the best textbook to read for bio-social Criminology.

Moving seamlessly between tactical details and analysis of strategic significance, Peter Cozzens presents a balanced, comprehensive account of a campaign that has long been romanticized but little understood. He offers new interpretations of the campaign and the reasons for Stonewall Jackson's success, demonstrates instances in which the mythology that has come to shroud the campaign has masked errors on Jackson's part, and provides the first detailed appraisal of Union leadership in the Valley Campaign, with some surprising conclusions.<br><br></p><p>"As campaign literature, this book stands out as a superlative narrative.

Learn more about their exciting and inspiring lives in Barbour's "Heroes of the Faith" series.<p>Recognizing from Romans 1 that God gives believers in Christ a positive righteousness, Luther refused to be silenced and became the great reformer.</p>Grade 7-9?A series of biographies reprinted from earlier paperback publications (Barbour, 1995, 1997). Their origins in earlier works survive in the elaborate language and a concentrated spiritual focus, making them difficult reading for young adults. Martin Luther has been "edited and abridged" from an adult title first published in 1933. It retains the florid language and difficult vocabulary of that era and assumes a basic knowledge of 16th-century politics and Lutheran theology unlikely to be found among teens. It is weakened, as is Wellman's book, by a lack of footnotes, table of contents, or preface. John Wesley is shown in a lifetime struggle between the strict discipline of his childhood faith and the desires of this heart. The author uses fictional dialogue and interior monologues to show the young minister's shift from smug self-righteousness to a sensitivity to the needs of the poor and an understanding of the power of charismatic preaching.

Ball</b> graduated from the Johns Hopkins Hospital School of Nursing, and subsequently received a BS from the Johns Hopkins University. She worked in the surgical, emergency, and outpatient units of the Johns Hopkins Children&#x2019;s Medical and Surgical Center, first as a staff nurse and then as a pediatric nurse practitioner, beginning her career as a pediatric nurse and advocate for children&#x2019;s health needs. Jane obtained both a master of public health and a doctor of public health degree from the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health with a focus on maternal and child health. After graduation she became the chief of child health services for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Health. In this capacity she oversaw the state-funded well-child clinics and explored ways to improve education for the state&#x2019;s community health nurses. After relocating to Texas, she joined the faculty at the University of Texas at Arlington School of Nursing to teach community pediatrics to registered nurses returning to school for a BSN. During this time she became involved in writing her first textbook, <i>Mosby&#x2019;s Guide to Physical Examination</i>, which is currently in its seventh edition. After relocating to the Washington, DC, area, she joined Children&#x2019;s National Medical Center to manage a federal project to teach instructors of emergency medical technicians from all states about the special care children need during an emergency. Exposure to the shortcomings of the emergency medical services system in the late 1980s with regard to pediatric care was a career-changing event. With federal funding, she developed educational curricula for emergency medical technicians and emergency nurses to help them provide improved care for children. A textbook entitled <i>Pediatric Emergencies, A Manual for Prehospital Providers</i> was developed from these educational ventures. For 15&nbsp;years she managed the federally funded Emergency Medical Services for Children&#x2019;s National Resource Center. As executive director, Dr. Ball directed the provision of consultation and resource development for state health agencies, health professionals, families, and advocates about successful methods to improve the health care system so that children get optimal emergency care in all health care settings. Having left that position, she devotes more time to writing and serves as a consultant to the American College of Surgeons, supporting state trauma system development. In 2010, Dr. Ball received the Distinguished Alumna Award from the Johns Hopkins University.<br> <br> <b>Ruth C. Bindler</b> received her BSN from Cornell University&#x2014;New York Hospital School of Nursing. She worked in oncology nursing at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, and then moved to Wisconsin and became a public health nurse in Dane County, Wisconsin. Thus began her commitment to work with children as she visited children and their families at home, and served as a school nurse for several elementary, middle, and high schools. Due to this interest in child health care needs, she earned her MS in child development from the University of Wisconsin. A move to Washington State was accompanied by a new job as a faculty member at the Intercollegiate Center for Nursing Education in Spokane. Dr. Bindler has been fortunate to be involved for over 35 years in the growth of this nursing education consortium, which is a combination of public and private universities and colleges and is now the Washington State University (WSU) College of Nursing. Ruth obtained a PhD in human nutrition at WSU. She has taught theory and clinical courses in child health nursing, cultural diversity and health, graduate research, pharmacology, and assessment, as well as serving as lead faculty for child health nursing and Associate Dean for Graduate Programs. She is now a professor emeritus at Washington State University. Her first professional book, <i>Pediatric Medications</i>, was published in 1981, and she has continued to publish articles and books in the areas of pediatric medications and pediatric health. Research efforts are focused in the area of childhood obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiometabolic risk factors in children. Ethnic diversity and interprofessional collaboration have been additional themes in her work. Dr. Bindler believes that her role as a faculty member has enabled her to learn continually, foster the development of students in nursing, lead and mentor junior faculty into the teaching role, and participate fully in the profession of nursing.

Cowen</b> received her BSN from East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina, and began her career as a staff nurse on the pediatric unit of North Carolina Baptist Hospital in Winston-Salem. She developed a special interest in the psychosocial needs of hospitalized children and preparing them for hospitalization. This led to the focus of her master&#x2019;s thesis at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG), where she received a master of science in nursing education degree with a focus in maternal child nursing.<br> <br> Mrs. Cowen began her teaching career in 1984 at UNCG, where she continues today as clinical professor in the Parent Child Department. Her primary responsibilities include coordinating the pediatric nursing course, teaching classroom content, and supervising a clinical group of students. Mrs. Cowen shared her passion for the psychosocial care of children and the needs of their families through her first experience as an author in the chapter &#x201c;Hospital Care for Children&#x201d; in Jackson &amp; Saunders&#x2019; <i>Child Health Nursing: A Comprehensive Approach to the Care of Children and Their Families</i>, published in 1993.<br> <br> In the classroom, Mrs. Cowen realized that students learn through a variety of teaching strategies and became especially interested in the strategy of gaming. She led a research study to evaluate the effectiveness of gaming in the classroom and subsequently continues to incorporate gaming in her teaching. In the clinical setting, Mrs. Cowen teaches her students the skills needed to care for patients and the importance of family-centered care, focusing on not only the physical needs of the child but also the psychosocial needs of the child and family.<br> <br> During her teaching career, Mrs. Cowen has continued to work part time as a staff nurse: first on the pediatric unit of Moses Cone Hospital in Greensboro and then at Brenner Children&#x2019;s Hospital in Winston-Salem. In 2006 she became the part-time pediatric nurse educator in Brenner&#x2019;s Family Resource Center. Through this role she is able to extend her love of teaching to children and families.<br> <br> Through her role as an author, Mrs. Cowen is able to extend her dedication to pediatric nursing and nursing education.

She began her career as a nurse at a long-term care facility and then as a home healthcare nurse in Spokane, Washington. While making home visits, she became interested in the nursing care needs of children and families. She realized the importance of educating the family about their child&#x2019;s condition and to include family members while planning and carrying out the nursing care plan. This interest in family nursing led her into the area of maternal-child nursing, where she served as a postpartum nurse for nearly 18 years. Her experience with providing nursing care to families in various settings has highlighted her belief in the need of a family-centered approach in order to provide optimal nursing care. <br> <br> Dr. Shaw began her teaching career as a teaching assistant in 2001 at the Washington State University (WSU) College of Nursing, where she continues today as an associate professor. It was during those early years as a teaching assistant that she began to realize her passion for educating nursing students. This interest led to her completing a master&#x2019;s degree in nursing with an emphasis on education at WSU. Knowing that she wanted to continue working in nursing academia, Dr. Shaw went on to receive her PhD in nursing from the University of Arizona in Tucson. She has taught theory, seminar, and clinical courses in maternal-child nursing, family health, evidence-based practice, ethical decision making, physical assessment, and professional practice. Dr. Shaw recently assisted in the development of the Bachelor of Science-to-PhD in Nursing program at WSU. This fast-track program will enable students with an earned bachelor&#x2019;s degree to complete a PhD in nursing in four years.<br> <br> Dr. Shaw enjoys working with undergraduate and graduate students and encourages active participation in research. Her research interests include children with asthma and their families, childbearing women and their families, and substance use among youth and childbearing women. She is particularly interested in children&#x2019;s and families&#x2019; unique perspectives, and thus much of her research uses qualitative approaches. She continues to publish articles in the areas of pediatric asthma and substance use among childbearing women. Dr. Shaw believes her active role in nursing academia and research allows her to stay current in various pedagogical approaches to enhance nursing students&#x2019; learning experiences, as well as continuous learning about evidence-based interventions to provide nursing care to children and families.</p></p><h2>Fundamentals of Physics: Student Solutions Manual</h2><p>Engaging students and teaching students to think critically isn&#x2019;t easy!

As a young ornithology instructor at the Hog Island Audubon Camp, Dr. Stephen W. Kress learned that puffins had nested on nearby islands until extirpated by hunters in the late 1800s. To right this environmental wrong, he resolved to bring puffins back to one such island&#x2014;Eastern Egg Rock. Yet bringing the plan to reality meant convincing skeptics, finding resources, and inventing restoration methods at a time when many believed in &#x201c;letting nature take its course.&#x201d;<br><br> Today, Project Puffin has restored more than 1,000 puffin pairs to three Maine islands. But even more exciting, techniques developed during the project have helped to restore rare and endangered seabirds worldwide. Further, reestablished puffins now serve as a window into the effects of global warming.

Written in the late years of the emperor Augustus, and cut short when the emperor sent the poet into exile, the poem's tone ranges from tragedy to farce, and its subject matter from astronomy and obscure ritual to Roman history and Greek mythology. Among the stories Ovid tells at length are those of Arion and the dolphin, the rape of Lucretia, the shield that fell from heaven, the adventures of Dido's sister, the Great Mother's journey to Rome, the killing of Remus, the bloodsucking birds, and the murderous daughter of King Servius. The poem also relates a wealth of customs and beliefs, such as the unluckiness of marrying in May. <br><br>This lively new edition by Anne and Peter Wiseman is the only modern prose translation of Ovid's Fasti and also the most accurate.

However hard Mrs Tim strives for seamless living amidst the other army wives, she is always moving flat-out to remember groceries, rule lively children, side-step village gossip and placate her husband with bacon, eggs, toast and marmalade. Left alone for months at a time whilst her husband is with his regiment, Mrs Tim resolves to keep a diary of events large and small in her family life. Once pen is set to paper no affairs of the head or heart are overlooked. When a move to a new regiment in Scotland uproots the Christie family, Mrs Tim is hurled into a whole new drama of dilemmas; from settling in with a new set whilst her husband is away, to disentangling a dear friend from an unsuitable match. Against the wild landscape of surging rivers, sheer rocks and rolling mists, who should stride into Mrs Tim&#39;s life one day but the dashing Major Morley, hellbent on pursuit of our charming heroine. And Hester will soon find that life holds unexpected crossroads...Mrs Tim of the Regiment is part of The Bloomsbury Group, a new library of books from the early twentieth-century chosen by readers for readers.</p><p>Dorothy Emily Stevenson was born in Edinburgh on the 18th, November 1892.

Employing a question-and-answer format, the authors seek to prompt readers of all kinds&#x2015;whether philosophers, historians, statesmen, theologians, combatants, or individuals&#x2015;to consider carefully the complex issues before them and to foster further investigation. When might war be right and peace be wrong, or vice versa? No question, regardless of difficulty, is off-limits for Charles and Demy, whose own perspectives are generously rooted in the natural moral law inscribed on the human heart, in a Christian worldview revealed in Scripture, and in the classic just-war tradition, which eschews both militarism and pacifism. War is hell on earth and the stakes are extremely high. This book provides much-needed theoretical and practical wisdom on this sadly perennial issue. In our post&#x2013;Cold War, terroristic, and morally ambivalent era, it couldn&#x2019;t be more timely.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<strong>David K. Naugle</strong><strong>,</strong> Chair and Professor of Philosophy, Dallas Baptist University</p><p>&#x201c;Charles and Demy have done a masterful job not only of posing the most important moral questions surrounding war but also of proposing trenchant and sophisticated answers to these questions firmly grounded in the natural-law tradition. As if that were not reason enough to purchase the book, the added benefit for theologians, church historians, ethicists, religious educators, and seminarians is that both authors, who write as evangelicals, find that the notion of natural law is resolutely affirmed in the work of the Protestant Reformers, who themselves were deeply concerned about issues of just governance, legitimate authority, civil society, and the common good, in addition to matters of faith, the church, and ecclesiastical culture. This book&#x2019;s treatment of these issues and far more is itself an excellent example of the equity that the authors think is characteristic of the just-war tradition. I highly recommend this book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Stephen J. Grabill</strong>, Senior Research Scholar in Theology, Acton Institute for the Study of Religion</p><p>&#x201c;As one who has written about just-war theory in the media during times of conflict, I find it refreshing to be able to recommend a book that explains that just war is not a theory that gives license to the use of violence, but one that attempts morally and responsibly to address the issue of the proper use of force. This book is well done and repays the time one gives to grapple with the difficult area of human conflict.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Darrell L. Bock</strong><strong>,</strong> Executive Director of Cultural Engagement, The Hendricks Center, Dallas Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;The new threats to international peace and security have cried out for moral clarity, for a fresh appraisal of the relevance of the Christian just-war tradition. In <em>War, Peace, and Christianity</em>, J. Daryl Charles and Timothy Demy have answered the call admirably. Unlike most of what passes for &#x2018;biblical ethics,&#x2019; their careful analysis refuses to use the Bible as a proof text for political propaganda. With great intelligence and common sense, the authors have assembled the insights of natural law, historical experience, political realism, and biblical theology. Those who hope to impose utopian schemes for world peace will find no comfort here. But those who seek justice as part of the command to &#x2018;love thy neighbor&#x2019; will find much wisdom to light the way.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Joseph Loconte</strong>, Associate Professor of History, The King's College; author, <em>God, Locke, and Liberty</em></p><p>&#x201c;Far too much recent commentary emanating from the Christian community on matters of war and peace has been ad hoc, sentimental, and ill-informed, without any grounding in the church&#x2019;s profound and nuanced tradition of moral and practical reflection on the subject. Charles and Demy have sought to address this problem, answering even the most knotty questions with lucid and learned essays that provide Christians of various backgrounds&#x2015;philosophers, historians, statesmen, theologians, combatants, and ordinary individuals&#x2015;with an inviting point of entry into that rich tradition. The result is a book to be grateful for, one that has the potential to improve the quality of our thinking on these essential matters.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Wilfred M. McClay</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;G.T. and Libby Blankenship Chair in the History of Liberty, University of Oklahoma</p><p>&#x201c;This is an important book. In an era when Christians are tempted to think that pacifism is the biblical and responsible position of a Jesus-follower, this volume makes a reasoned and erudite argument to the contrary. It makes available to readers a wealth of scholarship in a format that is inviting to the nonspecialist. I recommend this book for university courses in political science and ethics, to Sunday school classes on contemporary issues, and to thinking Christians considering one of our most urgent societal debates.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Gerald R.

My son, an Army Infantry officer on his third deployment to Iraq/Afghanistan, is dead center in the middle of this country&#x2019;s modern-day warfare&#x2015;international terrorism. In light of the statement &#x2018;there will always be evil men, and thus there will also be the need to restrain evil men,&#x2019; authors Charles and Demy tackle the tough questions: Are we justified in responding to and intervening in this global threat? What is our just-war theory toward rogue groups that target innocent people and our military? Does the United States of America have a moral obligation to militarily respond to global terrorism? Is all use of force just? What is the definition of classic just-war tradition and war against evil and injustice? This in-depth volume will answer these and many other pertinent questions that face our country today.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<strong>Robert J. Keneally</strong>, Lieutenant Colonel (Retired), United States Air Force</p><p>&#x201c;Charles and Demy have authored a book that carefully and clearly offers answers to some of the most important questions of our time concerning justice, war, and pacifism. Unlike some other Christian authors who approach these and similar questions, Charles and Demy maintain that justice, rather than the mere absence of conflict, should be the working principle that animates both citizen and soldier. In that sense, the authors hearken us back to the nonpacifist and non-&#x2018;realist,&#x2019; indeed Christian, roots of the just-war tradition.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Francis J.

Wilson, promises to be another &#x201c;eclectic, provocative collection&#x201d; (Entertainment Weekly) that is both a science reader&#x2019;s dream and a nature lover&#x2019;s sustenance.<br></p><p>From abstract reflections on the nature of mathematical thought to an all-too-concrete tale of teetering on the edge of an active volcano, <i>The Best American Science and Nature Writing 2001</i> delivers exactly what it promises. Editor Edward O. Wilson knows good writing when he sees it, and with names like David Berlinski, Barbara Kingsolver, and Jane Goodall in the table of contents, it's hard to know where to begin reading. All but the most diligent of readers will find something new herein--some topic, theory, or point of view that hasn't yet reached the mainstream. Stem cells, robots, cloning, and habitat loss all become more real thanks to the writers' vivid descriptions and imaginative explanations. The collection is a treat even for those with little background in science, as it provides an accessible overview of issues important to all informed world citizens. If only all science and nature writing were this appealing. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>Edward O.

About half of these areas were occupied or regularly used by indigenous peoples. Millions who had been living sustainably on their land for generations were displaced in the interests of conservation. In <i>Conservation Refugees</i>, Mark Dowie tells this story. This is a &#x201c;good guy vs. good guy&#x201d; story, Dowie writes; the indigenous peoples' movement and conservation organizations have a vital common goal&#x2015;to protect biological diversity&#x2015;and could work effectively and powerfully together to protect the planet and preserve biological diversity. Yet for more than a hundred years, these two forces have been at odds. The result: thousands of unmanageable protected areas and native peoples reduced to poaching and trespassing on their ancestral lands or &#x201c;assimilated&#x201d; but permanently indentured on the lowest rungs of the money economy. Dowie begins with the story of Yosemite National Park, which by the turn of the twentieth century established a template for bitter encounters between native peoples and conservation. He then describes the experiences of other groups, ranging from the Ogiek and Maasai of eastern Africa and the Pygmies of Central Africa to the Karen of Thailand and the Adevasis of India. He also discusses such issues as differing definitions of &#x201c;nature&#x201d; and &#x201c;wilderness,&#x201d; the influence of the &#x201c;BINGOs&#x201d; (Big International NGOs, including the Worldwide Fund for Nature, Conservation International, and The Nature Conservancy), the need for Western scientists to respect and honor traditional lifeways, and the need for native peoples to blend their traditional knowledge with the knowledge of modern ecology. When conservationists and native peoples acknowledge the interdependence of biodiversity conservation and cultural survival, Dowie writes, they can together create a new and much more effective paradigm for conservation.</p></p><p>Award-winning journalist Mark Dowie is the author of <i>Losing Ground: American Environmentalism at the Close of the Twentieth Century, American Foundations: An Investigative History</i> (both published by the MIT Press), and four other books.Starred Review. With a beautiful balance of critique and sympathy, Dowie (<i>Losing Ground</i>) challenges the halos of the major multinational conservation nonprofits, including the Nature Conservancy and the Worldwide Fund for Nature, in this exposï¿½ of their disastrous treatment and expulsions of indigenous peoples living in nature reserves and parks. Dowie traces the myth of wilderness as an idealized version of nature to John Muir, the Godfather of Conservation, who denied that Indians ever lived in Yosemite despite their longtime cultivation of the area; he was revolted by their eating habits and uncleanliness and said they had no place in the landscape. This American concoction of a pristine wilderness park, and the idea that humans are not a part of nature, was exported throughout the world, wreaking havoc among both dislocated indigenous people and the environments that they had nurtured with traditional knowledge, for hundreds, even thousands of years. Dowie comes to a surprisingly optimistic conclusion, noting recent collaborations between indigenous peoples and conservation organizations&#x2014;who are beginning to realize that only by preserving cultural diversity can biological diversity be protected, and vice versa. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For most people, this knowledge comes from happy experience with garlic-laced cuisines (and what notable culinary tradition is without it?), not book learning, and not working the fields to produce the aromatic bulb. For Stanley Crawford, the love of garlic comes from both scientific study and three decades of labor in the field to produce the exquisite bulbs, knowing full well that "if you grow good garlic people will love you for it." Crawford deserves similar affection for <i>Garlic Testament</i>, a lyrical memoir of his work as a farmer in northern New Mexico, one that combines autobiography, gardening hints, and a quiet philosophy of life. "Farming and writing are both labors ... conducted on flat planes in relative solitude," he writes, but in this fine book--which compares well with the work of fellow farmer-writer Wendell Berry--Crawford opens his gate and invites our company. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>"A treasure trove of planting lore [as] pungently powerful as [Crawford's] crop of choice."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>A List of Things That Didn&#39;t Kill Me: A Memoir</h2><p><p>Jason Schmidt wasn't surprised when he came home one day during his junior year of high school and found his father, Mark, crawling around in a giant pool of blood. Things like that had been happening a lot since Mark had been diagnosed with HIV, three years earlier.<br>Jason's life with Mark was full of secrets&#x2015;about drugs, crime, and sex. If the straights&#x2015;people with normal lives&#x2015;ever found out any of those secrets, the police would come. Jason's home would be torn apart. So the rule, since Jason had been in preschool, was never to tell the straights anything. </p><p><i>A List of Things That Didn't Kill Me</i> is a funny, disturbing memoir full of brutal insights and unexpected wit that explores the question: How do you find your moral center in a world that doesn't seem to have one?</p></p><p><p><b>Jason Schmidt</b> was born in Oregon in 1972. He has a law degree, and he lives with his family in Seattle, Washington.</p>Gr 10 Up&#x2014;In this disturbing, heartbreaking, and inspiring memoir, Schmidt provides an account of an unstable childhood and adolescence. The prologue begins with Schmidt at age 16, coming home to discover his father crawling around the floor, covered in blood. The author then pulls back, describing his early years. After Schmidt's parents separated, his father, Mark, took custody of him. The two moved from one decrepit home to the next in Seattle, as Mark abused and sold drugs, barely earning a living. Schmidt's voice will resonate with teens as he writes candidly about his father's negligence and abuse, adeptly capturing what it was like to grow up impoverished, the hostility he encountered at school, the injuries and illnesses he endured, his difficulty finding and keeping friends, and the challenges of adjusting to his gay father's unstable romantic and sexual life. As Schmidt grew older, he believed more and more that he and Mark could never become "straights," or normal people. When the author reached adolescence, during the early 1980s, Mark and many of his friends were diagnosed with AIDS. It was a period when many gay men were dying, when those with HIV faced stigma, and when the effectiveness of medical treatment was minimal. Once realizing his father's fate, Schmidt feared what the future had in store but was inspired to take control of his life.

Around him were treasures of Chinese art: temple bells, porcelains, silk wall hangings. This day, through the wavy glass panes of the library windows, he could see a fall breeze rustle the red and gold leaves on the trees, and the sun glitter on the river. The air was crisp, and a coal fire glowed in the hearth. Penning letters to family and friends, with advice on business and stern judgments about character, he was at home, in charge, and seemingly at ease, managing a business empire that spanned the globe.<br> <br>Fifty years old in the fall of 1859, Delano was a tough man to the core: well over six feet tall, with chiseled features, a hooked nose, a leonine beard, and bristling sideburns. Suspicious of strangers, he loved his family without reservation. All coldness melted away when his six children tumbled around the library, as they often did while he worked. If two of them got into a fight over a toy, he would look up from his desk, smile, utter firmly, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that? Tut, tut!&#x201d; and the squabble would stop. It was not fear of the patriarch but fear of disappointing him that kept his children well behaved. He never spanked them. Nor did he share his worries on days when letters brought ill news. In the words of one daughter, he had a remarkable knack for hiding &#x201c;all traces of sadness or trouble or news of anything alarming.&#x201d;2 To be a true Delano, one had to keep a pleasant disposition, no matter what life threw at you.<br> <br>The Delano clan had been risking their lives on the high seas ever since the Flemish Protestant adventurer Philippe Delannoy first made the Atlantic crossing to the Plymouth Bay Colony in 1621. Building the family&#x2019;s maritime fortunes required spending much of life apart from those they loved, and demanded a delicate balance of poise on land and toughness at sea. It was a fact of life in seagoing New England: the longer the absence and the larger the risks, the greater the financial rewards. The old whale-hunting cry &#x201c;A dead whale or a stove boat!&#x201d; could well have been the family&#x2019;s motto.I<br> <br>For two centuries, the clan had sacrificed much to attain modest prosperity. But Warren Delano&#x2019;s opulent fortune had sprung from his mastery of another kind of maritime gamble: trading in tea and opium. He had made two visits to China as a young man, first as a bachelor, and then with his wife, Catherine, whom he had married only a few weeks before they set sail. They had lost their first-born child in that country, a tragedy that had driven his young bride to near-suicidal despair. Another child would come home chronically ill.<br> <br>Yet Warren was expert at keeping his private emotional life divorced from the grand vision by which he and his contemporaries had transformed the world. Their hard work had made a young republic into one of the world&#x2019;s great commercial sea powers, with a fleet of fast ships that challenged Great Britain&#x2019;s maritime supremacy. The success of Yankee clippers, which Delano helped mastermind, shook Old Britannia&#x2019;s complacency, cracking ancient, restrictive trade laws that had kept foreign-built vessels out of British ports. &#x201c;We must run a race with our gigantic and unshackled rival,&#x201d; snarled the London Times upon the first visit to London of a Yankee clipper, in 1850. &#x201c;We must set our long-practiced skill, our steady industry, and our dogged determination against his youth, industry, and ardor.&#x201d;3 The American clipper in question, Oriental, had cut the trip from China to London nearly in half, from six months to a mere 97 days, and her cargo of tea sold for a whopping $48,000. This was at a time when an average American worker made between $10 and $12 a month.4<br> <br>Delano&#x2019;s great wealth from trade had allowed him to remove his family to Algonac, a sixty-acre estate north of New York City. The mammoth scale of the house was in no small part inspired by a great rambling palace Delano had seen on the banks of China&#x2019;s Pearl River many years before, while it also reflected the latest in nineteenth-century American architectural fashion. The architect, Andrew Jackson Downing, was a proponent of the &#x201c;picturesque&#x201d;: a whimsical Gothic window here, a wood-and-glass cupola there. Downing seems to have understood his seagoing but home-loving client. As a self-taught tastemaker, Downing skillfully used his pen to appeal to the longings of his prosperous but increasingly harried bourgeois clientele. &#x201c;The mere sentiment of home,&#x201d; Downing mused in The Architecture of Country Houses, &#x201c;has, like a strong anchor, saved many a man from shipwreck in the storms of life.&#x201d;5<br> <br>For Delano, Algonac did exactly that. The tan stucco house, designed in the Tuscan villa style and adorned with towers, gables, and wide porches, was his fortress&#x2014;a refuge from all of the uncertainties that had dogged his early life. Screened in by stone walls and tall trees, Warren was the realm&#x2019;s benevolent yet exacting ruler. Here, all of the world&#x2019;s problems were kept at bay, and all of life&#x2019;s questions answered. He played games with his children and tended his fruit trees. He and Catherine wrote what they called their &#x201c;Algonac Diaries,&#x201d; lovingly describing their children&#x2019;s &#x201c;explosions of fire-crackers,&#x201d; and one particularly &#x201c;splendid bonfire in the henyard.&#x201d;6 The crash of a gong summoned the family to their evening meal, in an east-facing dining room with a spectacular view of the Hudson River.<br> <br>Yet Warren didn&#x2019;t tell stories to his children about his time in China as a young man&#x2014;the violence he had lived through, or his loneliness there before Catherine, or facing down the hard edges of life on the other side of the world. He was determined that his children not go through what he&#x2019;d experienced. For all his present comfort, he knew what it had taken to make his money, in a foreign country, skirting the fringes of the law.<br> <br>At Algonac, there was a silent witness to the source of his wealth, in spirit if not in life: a Chinese patriarch was enshrined in an oil painting that hung in the paneled library. He had a thin, pinched face and melancholy eyes, and he was dressed splendidly in flowing silk robes, necklaces of bright jade. A close-fitting cap, topped with the red coral button that denoted his high &#x201c;mandarin&#x201d; social status in the Chinese governmental hierarchy, sat next to him on the table.<br> <br>This was Houqua, the great Chinese merchant whose favor had helped make Warren Delano one of America&#x2019;s richest men. By 1859, the man in the painting had been dead for more than ten years. But through the first half of the nineteenth century, he had been one of the wealthiest men in the world, and a financial father to Delano and other young American merchants of that time. The painting at Algonac was a gift from Houqua himself. Every partner at Delano&#x2019;s firm, Russell &amp; Company&#x2014;the largest and most profitable American enterprise in China&#x2014;brought home a portrait of Houqua. His visage adorned counting rooms in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. So revered was the great merchant that one of Delano&#x2019;s partners named his tea-carrying ship, arguably the first of the sleek Yankee clippers, in Houqua&#x2019;s honor.<br> <br>In the years since his time under Houqua&#x2019;s patronage, Warren Delano had invested the fortune he had made from his Chinese business into more clipper ships, and then into copper and coal mines, Manhattan real estate, and railroads. Delano himself had achieved tremendous stature, not only for his wealth but also for his character. One contemporary wrote, &#x201c;He was a man of quick perceptions, accurate judgment, indomitable will, and possessed in a remarkable degree the rich endowment of common sense . . . the result of clear thinking and strict adherence to the facts.&#x201d;7<br> <br>Yet by that fall day in 1859, the business letters Delano was writing from the library at Algonac were getting increasingly frantic. A financial panic two years earlier, triggered by speculation in railroads, had caused his investments to suffer. His clipper ships were particularly hard hit. Within several months of the crash, he had gone from being a millionaire to being close to penniless. Despite Delano&#x2019;s obsession with privacy at Algonac, there was no way to keep this financial cataclysm away from his family hearth. Meanwhile, America was hurtling toward the reckoning between North and South, a conflict from which even the gates of Algonac could not shelter the Delanos.<br> <br>Warren Delano had a big family, an expensive house, and above all, a reputation to maintain. He had taken big risks throughout his life, and now, staring at bankruptcy, he was not about to sit still. He saw only one way to avoid certain ruin: he would return to China and the opium and tea trade.<br> <br>His wife and six children would remain at Algonac. Warren promised Catherine, several months pregnant with their seventh child, that he would be gone only two years. She did her best to keep calm as he packed his bags and prepared to leave. She knew firsthand the danger of ocean travel and the volatile political situation in China, a country where Westerners were not welcomed as guests but rather derided in the streets as fanqui. Foreign devils.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>When Warren Delano boarded ship in the Port of New York, the sounds and smells around him would not have differed greatly from the scenes of his first voyage more than a quarter century before: the tang of salt water, the shouts of the sailors, the thunder of the canvas as it dropped from the yards and captured the wind, and the gentle motion of the deck as the vessel glided through the Upper Bay and then out into the gray expanse of the North Atlantic. In his ears would be the sonorous calls of the chanteymen, singing work songs to keep time as they hauled in the lines and spun the capstans&#x2014;old sailing songs, tuned to the new clipper era:<br> <br>Down by the river hauled a Yankee clipper,<br> <br>And it&#x2019;s blow, my bully boys, blow!<br> <br>She&#x2019;s a Yankee mate and a Yankee skipper,<br> <br>And it&#x2019;s blow, my bully boys, blow!<br> <br>The name of the ship that took him on this voyage is lost to history, but it was almost certainly one of those rakish, swift vessels that he helped pioneer: majestic clippers, flying before the wind like great birds of prey, their vast spreads of canvas stretched taut, their deep, sharp bows piercing wave after wave. On such a vessel, the trip would take fewer than three months. When Warren had first gone to China in 1833, six months was considered an acceptable run. In this respect alone, time spent aboard ship had changed.<br> <br>Still, life on a long sea voyage would have quickly worn thin: dinners with the captain; letter writing; endlessly rereading the same books and outdated periodicals such as Harper&#x2019;s Weekly; listening to other passengers tell stories, play the piano, or sing. Delano had played the guitar as a young man. Perhaps now he sang a few songs with his fellow passengers to pass the time.8 But this private man likely despised being forced into the shipboard company of people he didn&#x2019;t know. At night, his huge frame jammed into a narrow berth built for a much smaller man, he may have stared out his port light and yearned for Algonac and his family.<br> <br>An ocean away, his five-year-old daughter, Sara, found the separation from her beloved Papa hard to bear. She later remembered her father vanishing without explanation. As many Yankee children lamented, &#x201c;Dear papa done Tanton [gone Canton].&#x201d;9 When Warren&#x2019;s letters began to arrive, young Sara steamed off the stamps and pasted them in her collection.10<br> <br>The letters meant that Warren Delano had arrived safely. Renting a large house called Rose Hill and settling into his Russell &amp; Company duties, Delano was going back to the work he knew. He missed his family, but he was making money&#x2014;as he had done thirty years ago.<br> <br>I.

Lucko</p><h2>The Bad Seed: A Vintage Movie Classic</h2><p><b>The bestselling novel that inspired Mervyn LeRoy&#x2019;s classic horror film about the little girl who can get away with anything&#x2014;even murder.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> There&#x2019;s something special about eight-year-old Rhoda Penmark. With her carefully plaited hair and her sweet cotton dresses, she&#x2019;s the very picture of old-fashioned innocence. But when their neighborhood suffers a series of terrible accidents, her mother begins to wonder: Why do bad things seem to happen when little Rhoda is around? <br> &nbsp;<br> Originally published in 1954, William March&#x2019;s final novel was an instant bestseller and National Book Award finalist before it was adapted for the stage and made into a 1956 film. <i>The Bad Seed</i> is an indelible portrait of an evil that wears an innocent face, one which still resonates in popular culture today.&nbsp;<br><br>With a new foreword by <b>Anna Holmes</b>.<br><br><b>Vintage Movie Classics</b> spotlights classic films that have stood the test of time, now rediscovered through the publication of the novels on which they were based.</p><p>William March (1893&#x2013;1954), born William Edward March Campbell in Mobile, Alabama, was an American novelist and short-story writer. He served in the Marines during World War I, and was recognized with the Distinguished Service Cross, the Navy Cross, and the Croix de Guerre. His first novel, <i>Company K</i>, was based largely on his wartime experiences. A prolific writer of short stories, he was a four-time winner of the O. Henry Prize. <i>The Bad Seed </i>was an immediate critical and commercial success, the source for a Tony Award-winning Broadway play and a finalist for the National Book Award. Sadly, March died of a heart attack just weeks after publication.<p><b>Foreword</b><br><br> by Anna Holmes&nbsp;<br><br> I suppose if a novelist is going to imagine and give life to a character meant to be a memorable but also totally unexpected serial killer, it makes sense that he make her not only a young child but also a girl. Though readers may be more familiar with Macaulay Culkin&#x2019;s apple-cheeked child psycho in 1993&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Good Son</i>, the grade-school sociopath to which all contemporary child killers can, and should, be compared is Rhoda Penmark, the focus of William March&#x2019;s 1954 bestselling novel,&nbsp;<i>The Bad Seed</i>. Eight years old, with straight brown hair and a desire for tidiness that seems to border on the obsessive, Rhoda boasts an old-fashioned name and a stereotypically feminine, highly controlled style of dress and disposition that seem to be at extreme odds with her willingness to, for example, toss terrier puppies to their deaths from bedroom windows. And she&#x2019;s driving her mother, the overly cautious housewife Christine Penmark, literally crazy.&nbsp;<br><br> Of course, it&#x2019;s not just animals who invoke the wrath of Rhoda P., Kid Creep: Children and adults alike are subject to her special form of homicidal dispensation, giving lie to the nineteenth century nursery rhyme that little girls are made of &#x201c;sugar and spice and everything nice.&#x201d; Indeed, it&#x2019;s likely that part of what made&nbsp;<i>The Bad Seed</i>&nbsp;so terrifying and unsettling to midcentury American readers is author William March&#x2019;s juxtaposition of the younger Penmark&#x2019;s external performance of obedient, coquettish femininity&#x2014;&#x201c;Oh, my old-fashioned little darling!&#x201d; exclaims one of Rhoda&#x2019;s admirers, her neighbor Monica Breedlove, early on in the text&#x2014;with what are commonly thought to be more masculine traits: the covetousness, ruthlessness, and lack of control that inspire most of her calculated crimes of convenience. This dissonance between how Rhoda appears on the outside and who she is on the inside is further underscored by her aforementioned appearance, all pressed dotted-Swiss dresses and trimmed bangs and perfectly twisted pigtails.&nbsp;<br><br> About those pigtails. In the film version of the book, released in 1956, Mr. March&#x2019;s Rhoda, she of the &#x201c;straight, finespun, and...dark, dull brown&#x201d; hair, is reimagined as a towheaded terror in the form of actress Patty McCormack, who received an Academy Award nomination for her performance. Director Mervyn LeRoy&#x2019;s choice to take a page from Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s playbook and make the celluloid Rhoda a blonde served to accentuate not just the character&#x2019;s iciness but to communicate a certain innocence and fragility, making her appear more like a doll than a flesh-and-blood human being. Indeed, the film version feels prescient in the ways that it seems to presage and anticipate any number of scary killer dolls from cinematic history, including the braided moppets from the 1963&nbsp;<i>Twilight Zone</i>&nbsp;episode &#x201c;Living Doll&#x201d; and 2013&#x2019;s paranormal thriller&nbsp;<i>The Conjuring</i>. Descriptions of Rhoda&#x2019;s appearance and countenance in the book reinforce this: She walks stiffly and somewhat carefully; her hair is arranged in the sort of perfectly ordered, taut plaits that only a factory assembly line could produce; and she seems to be capable of two, maybe three expressions&#x2014;blank solemnity, irresistible cuteness, and flashing anger.&nbsp;<br><br> Though not exactly a character study, it&#x2019;s possible that William March&#x2019;s criminalizing of a young female was supposed to be both provocative and maybe even political, that in making an adorable little girl an ice-cold killer somehow our ideas of femininity and decorum and preciousness were going to be upended, and violently. (It was the mid-1950s, after all, a time in which expectations for womanhood and the cultivation of comfortable, safe domestic arrangements were at an all-time high, expectations that came under fire in Betty Friedan&#x2019;s seminal&nbsp;<i>The Feminine Mystique</i>, published less than a decade later.) It&#x2019;s unlikely, however, that the film would have the same deleterious effect on the contemporary reading or theater-going public, as familiar with and desensitized as it is to the concept of the multiple murderess. (This might explain why, when Hostel director Eli Roth considered doing a remake of&nbsp;<i>The Bad Seed</i>, he made it clear that he wanted lots of blood and gore&#x2014;there isn&#x2019;t any in either the film or the book&#x2014;explaining to interviewers that he thought Rhoda deserved the sort of horror icon status enjoyed by the character Chucky from&nbsp;<i>Child&#x2019;s Play</i>, an actual killer doll. &#x201c;We are going to bastardize and exploit it, ramping up the body counts and killings,&#x201d; he told<i>Variety</i>&nbsp;in 2004.)&nbsp;<br><br> But reading&nbsp;<i>The Bad Seed</i>, one eventually gets the sense that Mr. March is not so much celebrating expressions of female power and agency as fearing them; his contempt for the other female characters he&#x2019;s created is palpable. (The men in the book are, for the most part, emasculated, impotent, or completely invisible.) There is Hortense Daigle, the drunk, hysterical, and smothering mother of one of Rhoda&#x2019;s young victims, Claude Daigle; Mrs. Breedlove, a busybody neighbor who prides herself on her understanding of human behavior yet remains blind to the psychological monstrosity standing in front of her; and, of course, the anxious, selfless Christine Penmark, the person considered responsible for her daughter&#x2019;s misdeeds&#x2014;Christine&#x2019;s own &nbsp;mother was a psycho killer, March explains, meaning that the evil is matrilineal&#x2014;and seemingly unable to stop them.<br><br> This is where Mr. March&#x2019;s book is most problematic. The esteemed feminist and literary critic Elaine Showalter, in an introduction to a 1997 HarperCollins edition of the book, explains that &#x201c;as in much of March&#x2019;s writing, women in&nbsp;<i>The Bad Seed</i>&nbsp;are more sinister than men,&#x201d; and though she swats him for the book&#x2019;s implicit message that at the root of much conflict and societal upheaval are &#x201c;castrating wives and mothers,&#x201d; Showalter does not go far enough in indicting him for these and other hoary tropes he traffics in, including but not limited to the clueless gossip; the prim, status-obsessed educator; and of course, Rhoda herself, a femme fatale who becomes the object of affection even to those who ought to fear her most. &#x201c;In a sense, he was in love with the little girl,&#x201d; writes Mr. March about Leroy Jessup, an apartment-building janitor whom Rhoda will eventually burn to death in a highly disturbing scene during the book&#x2019;s denouement. &#x201c;His persecution of her, his nagging concern with everything she did, was part of a perverse and frightened courtship.&#x201d; As Showalter herself puts it, one could say the same about the relationship between the author of&nbsp;<i>The Bad Seed</i>&nbsp;himself and the grotesque version of femininity he imagined and then committed to paper.&nbsp;<br><br> It probably says something about the evolution in attitudes about gender and girlhood&#x2014;not to mention mental illness and sociopathy&#x2014;that William March&#x2019;s book would be unlikely to have the same chilling or shocking effect were it published for the first time today. For one thing, our ideas about good and evil have been complicated and expanded upon thanks to advances in the fields of psychology and criminology, not to mention child development. For another, broadened expectations for women and girls mean that, for better or worse, we are seen as more fully realized human beings, not cartoonish ciphers that either adhere to or reject conventional ideas about what females are capable of. If there&#x2019;s anything in&nbsp;<i>The Bad Seed</i>&nbsp;that resonates strongly today, it&#x2019;s the ways in which acts of violence are celebrated as legitimate responses to thwarted entitlement. But that&#x2019;s part of the problem with America, not with its boys (or girls)<br> &nbsp;<br><b> One</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Later that summer, when Mrs. Penmark looked back and remembered, when she was caught up in despair so deep that she knew there was no way out, no solution whatever for the circumstances that encompassed her, it seemed to her that June seventh, the day of the Fern Grammar School picnic, was the day of her last happiness, for never since then had she known contentment or felt peace.&nbsp;<br><br> The picnic was an annual, traditional affair held on the beach and among the oaks of Benedict, the old Fern summer place at Pelican Bay. It was here that the impeccable Fern sisters had been born and had lived through their languid, eventless summers. They had refused to sell the old place, and had kept it up faithfully as a gesture of love even when necessity made them turn their town house into a school for the children of their friends. The picnic was always held on the first Saturday of June since the eldest of the three sisters, Miss Octavia, was convinced, despite the occasions on which it had rained that particular day, and the picnic had to be held inside after all, that the first Saturday of June was an invariably fine one.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;When I was a little girl, as young as many of you are today,&#x201d; she would say each season to her pupils, &#x201c;we always planned a picnic at Benedict for the first Saturday of June. All our relatives and friends came&#x2014;some of whom we&#x2019;d not seen for months. It was sort of a reunion, really, with laughter and surprises and gentle, excited voices everywhere. Everyone had a happy, beautiful day. There was no dissension on those days; a quarrel was unknown in the society of the well-bred, a cross word never exchanged between ladies and gentlemen. My sisters and I remember those days with love and great longing.&#x201d;<br><br> At this point Miss Burgess Fern, the middle sister, the practical one who handled the business affairs of the school, said, &#x201c;It was so much easier in those days, with a houseful of servants and everybody helpful and anxious to please. Mother and some of the servants would drive down to Benedict a few days in advance of the picnic, sometimes as early as the first of June, when the season was officially open, although the established residents of the coast didn&#x2019;t consider the season really in swing until the day of our picnic.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Benedict is such a beautiful spot,&#x201d; said Miss Claudia Fern. &#x201c;Little Lost River bounds our property on the Gulf side, and flows into the bay there.&#x201d; Miss Claudia taught art in the school, and automatically she added, &#x201c;The landscape at that point reminds one so much of those charming river scenes by Bombois.&#x201d; Then, feeling that some of her pupils might not know who Bombois was, she went on. &#x201c;For the sake of some of the younger groups, Bombois is a modern French primitive. Oh, he is so cunning in his artlessness! So right in his composition, and in the handling of green! You&#x2019;ll learn much about Bombois later on.&#x201d;<br><br> It was from the Fern town house, the school itself, that the picnickers were to begin their long day of pleasure; and the parents of each pupil had been asked to have their particular child on the school lawn not later than eight o&#x2019;clock, when the chartered busses were scheduled to leave. Thus it was that Mrs. Christine Penmark, who disliked being late or keeping others waiting, set her clock for six, which, she felt, would allow time for her ordinary tasks of the morning and for the remembrance of those last-minute, hurried things which are so easily overlooked.&nbsp;<br><br> She had impressed the hour on her mind, saying to herself as she fell asleep, &#x201c;You will awake precisely at six o&#x2019;clock, even if something happens to the alarm&#x201d;; but the alarm went off promptly, and, yawning a little, she sat up in bd. It was, she saw instantly, to be a beautiful day&#x2014;the day Miss Octavia had promised. She pushed back her blond, almost flaxen, hair and went at once to the bathroom, staring at herself in the mirror for a long moment, her toothbrush held languidly in her hand, as though she were not quite decided what to do with it. Her eyes were gray, wide-set, and serene; her skin tanned and firm. She drew back her lips in that first tentative, trial smile of the day; and standing thus in front of her mirror, she listened absently to the sounds outside her window: an automobile starting in the distance, the twittering of sparrows in the live oaks that lined the quiet street, the sound of a child&#x2019;s voice raised suddenly and then hushed. Then, coming awake quickly, in possession once more of her usual energy, she bathed and dressed and went to her kitchen to begin breakfast.&nbsp;<br><br> Later she went to her daughter&#x2019;s room to waken her. The room was empty, and it was so tidy that it gave the impression not having been used for a long time. The bed was nearly remade, the dressing-table immaculate, with each object in its accustomed place, turned at its usual angle. On a table near the window was one of the jigsaw puzzles that her daughter delighted in, a puzzle only half completed. Mrs. Penmark smiled to herself and went into the child&#x2019;s bathroom. The bathroom was as orderly as the bedroom had been, with the bath towel spread out precisely to dry; and Christine, seeing these things laughed softly, thinking: I never deserved such a capable child. When I was eight years old, I doubt if I could do anything. She went into the wide, elaborate hall with its elegant, old-fashioned parquetry floors of contrasting woods, and called gaily, &#x201c;Rhoda! Rhoda! . . . Where are you, darling? Are you up and dressed so soon?&#x201d;<br><br> The child answered in her slow, cautions voice, as though the speaking of words were a perilous thing to be debated. &#x201c;Here I am,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Here, in the living-room.&#x201d;<br><br> When speaking of her daughter, the adjectives that others most often used were &#x201c;quaint,&#x201d; or &#x201c;modest,&#x201d; or &#x201c;old-fashioned&#x201d;; and Mrs. Penmark, standing in the doorway, smiled in agreement and wondered from what source the child had inherited her repose, her neatness, her cool self-sufficiency. She said, coming into the room, &#x201c;Were you really able to comb and plait your hair without my helping you?&#x201d;<br><br> The child half turned, so that her mother could inspect her hair, which was straight, finespun, and of a dark, dull brown: her hair was plaited precisely in two narrow braids which were looped back into two thin hangman-nooses, and were secured, in turn, with two small bows of ribbon. Mrs. Penmark examined the bows, but seeing they were compact and firmly tied, she brushed her lips over the child&#x2019;s brown bangs, and said, &#x201c;Breakfast will be ready in a moment. I think you&#x2019;d better eat a good breakfast today as there&#x2019;s nothing more uncertain about a picnic than the arrival of lunch.&#x201d;<br><br> Rhoda sat down at the table, her face fixed in an expression of solemn innocence; then she smiled at some secret thought of her own, and at once there was a shallow dimple in her left cheek. She lowered her chin and raised it thoughtfully; she smiled again, but very softly, an odd, hesitant smile that parted her lips this time and showed the small, natural gap between her front teeth.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Semantics: Volume 2</h2><p>This book, which can be read independently, deals with more specifically linguistic problems in semantics and contains substantial original material.</p><p>An independent volume dealing specifically with linguistic problems in semantics.

Canvases such as Drugstore, New York Movie, and the universally recognized (and often parodied) Nighthawks not only reshaped what painting looked like in America, but created a visual language for middle-class life and its discontents. This extensive new assessment of Hopper, which accompanies a major traveling exhibition, examines the dynamics of the artist&#39;s creative process and discusses his work within the cultural currents of his day--examining the influence not only of other painters, but also of such media as literature and film. And while most studies have tended to see Hopper as the great painter of alienation, this one takes a much broader, more nuanced, and ultimately more representative view.

Writing some twelve hundred years later, the Ming author Luo Guanzhong drew on histories, dramas, and poems portraying the crisis to fashion a sophisticated, compelling narrative that has become the Chinese national epic. This abridged edition captures the novel's intimate and unsparing view of how power is wielded, how diplomacy is conducted, and how wars are planned and fought.

The following decades saw the mysteries of the heart exposed, thanks to pioneering surgeons, brave patients and even sacrificial dogs.</p><p> In eleven landmark operations, Thomas Morris tells us stories of triumph, reckless bravery, swaggering arrogance, jealousy and rivalry, and incredible ingenuity: the trail-blazing &#x2018;blue baby&#x2019; procedure that transformed wheezing infants into pink, healthy children; the first human heart transplant, which made headline news around the globe.

Now, five decades after he published his first pioneering book on cellular slime molds, Bonner steps back from the proliferating and increasingly specialized knowledge about the organism to provide a broad, nontechnical picture of its whole biology, including its evolution, sociobiology, ecology, behavior, and development. <i>The Social Amoebae</i> draws the big lessons from decades of research, and shows how slime molds fit into and illuminate biology as a whole.</p><br><p> Slime molds are very different from other organisms; they feed as individual amoebae before coming together to form a multicellular organism that has a remarkable ability to move and orient itself in its environment. Furthermore, these social amoebae display a sophisticated division of labor; within each organism, some cells form the stalk and others become the spores that will seed the next generation. In <i>The Social Amoebae</i>, Bonner examines all these parts together, giving a balanced, concise, and clear overview of slime mold biology, from molecules to cells to multicells, as he advances some unconventional and unexpected insights.</p></p><p><p>"Few scientists or authors can claim that the analyses and insights in their latest book are based on sixty years of original research, exploration, and childlike enthusiasm. We should be enormously grateful that John Tyler Bonner could make that claim about the career he has spent with cellular slime molds. His book is beautifully written, enlightening, fascinating, historical yet up-to-date, whimsical when appropriate, and informative throughout in its analysis of two of evolution's major themes--multicellular organization and sociality."<b>--Brian Hall, coauthor of <i>Strickberger's Evolution</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Social Amoebae</i> provides a rounded and complete picture of cellular slime mold biology for the interested lay person, but even researchers in the field will learn a lot. John Tyler Bonner ties the ecological context to developmental questions and connects modern molecular data to ingenious experiments performed more than forty years ago. Written in an easy, flowing, elegant style, the book is spiced up with delightful anecdotes, and I very much enjoyed reading it."<b>--Pauline Schaap, University of Dundee</b></p><p>"A conversation with all those students working in labs on individual features of slime mold biology, <i>The Social Amoebae</i> might well induce readers to think more broadly about the organism."<b>--Leo W.

Despite remaining popular and profitable into the twenty-first century, the game is losing young fans, among African Americans and women as well as white men. Furthermore, baseball&#x2019;s greatest charm&#x2014;a clockless suspension of time&#x2014;is also its greatest liability in a culture of digital distraction.<br><br> These paradoxes are explored by the historian and passionate baseball fan Susan Jacoby in a book that is both a love letter to the game and a tough-minded analysis of the current challenges to its special position&#x2014;in reality and myth&#x2014;in American culture. The concise but wide-ranging analysis moves from the Civil War&#x2014;when many soldiers played ball in northern and southern prisoner-of-war camps&#x2014;to interviews with top baseball officials and young men who prefer playing online &#x201c;fantasy baseball&#x201d; to attending real games.<br><br> Revisiting her youthful days of watching televised baseball in her grandfather&#x2019;s bar, the author links her love of the game with the informal education she received in everything from baseball&#x2019;s history of racial segregation to pitch location. Jacoby argues forcefully that the major challenge to baseball today is a shortened attention span at odds with a long game in which great hitters fail two out of three times. Without sanitizing this basic problem, <i>Why Baseball Matters </i>remind us that the game has retained its grip on our hearts precisely because it has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to reinvent itself in times of immense social change.</p><p><b>Susan Jacoby</b> is the author of eleven previous books, including the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller <i>The Age of American Unreason</i>.

Jacoby, whose scholarly focus is on religious liberty and atheism, wrote this entry in Yale's &#x2018;Why X Matters&#x2019; series on the national pastime, detailing how the game connects people to each other and to the past.

Numerous black and white illustrations by noted illustrator Walter Crane enliven the narrative. Suitable for ages 9 and up.</p><p>Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804-1864) was born in Salem, Massachusetts, and made his ambition to be a writer while still a teenager. He graduated from Bowdoin College in Maine, where the poet Longfellow was also a student, and spent several years travelling in New England and writing short stories before his best-known novel The Scarlet Letter was published in 1850. His writing was not at first financially rewarding and he worked as measurer and surveyor in the Boston and Salem Custom Houses. In 1853 he was sent to Liverpool as American consul and then lived in Italy before returning to the US in 1860, where he died in his sleep four years later.<br>"A handsome replica of the original 1893 edition, <em>A Wonder Book for Girls &amp; Boys</em> by Nathaniel Hawthorne features Medusa, Hercules, Pandora, Midas et al--and the art of the illustrious Walter Crane....

Derrida's original title, "Artaud the Moma," is a characteristic play on words. It alludes to Artaud's calling himself Mï¿½mo, Marseilles slang for "fool," upon his return to Paris in 1946 after nine years in various asylums, while playing off of the museum's nickname, MoMA. But the title was not deemed "presentable or decent," in Derrida's words, by the very institution that chose to exhibit Artaud's work. Instead, the lecture was advertised as "Jacques Derrida . . . will present a lecture about Artaud's drawings."<br><br>For Derrida, what was at stake was what it meant for the museum to exhibit Artaud's drawings and for him to lecture on Artaud in that institutional context. Thinking over the performative force of Artaud's work and the relation between writing and drawing, Derrida addresses the multiplicity of Artaud's identities to confront the modernist museum's valorizing of originality. He channels Artaud's specter, speech, and struggle against representation to attempt to hold the museum accountable for trying to confine Artaud within its categories. <i>Artaud the Moma</i>, as lecture and text, reveals the challenge that Artaud posed to Derrida&#x2015;and to art and its institutional history. A powerful interjection into the museum halls, this work is a crucial moment in Derrida's thought and an insightful, unsparing reading of a challenging writer and artist.</p><p>Jacques Derrida (1930-2004) was one of the twentieth century's most prolific and influential philosophers. He was director at the Ecole des hautes ï¿½tudes en sciences sociales in Paris and professor of humanities at the University of California, Irvine.<br><br>Kaira M.

It is the most amazing attempt ever written&#x2015;brilliant, baroque, unstoppable&#x2015;to confront the mad poet's vociferations and relentless scatology in their own terms while resisting his metaphysical rage for reappropriation.

There is new material in the book by Israel Regardie from the archives of the Israel Regardie Foundation, as well as material by Chic and Tabatha Cicero, Lon Milo DuQuette, Jack Willis and S. Jason Black. The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic was Israel Regardie&#39;s last book, his Magnum Opus, and the final token of his True Will. Through this book he bequeathed to us the means to carry on the Great Work of the Golden Dawn.</p><p>Israel Regardie (1907-1985) was an Adept of the Golden Dawn and he was one of the greatest exponents of the Western Esoteric Tradition of the 20th century. He was also an initiate of Aleister Crowley's Order of the A.ï¿½. A.ï¿½., and he was a IXth degree initiate of Crowley's O.T.O. It was his aim to preserve the teachings and work of the Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley. His success in this task has profoundly influenced occult thought. From the age of 21, Regardie worked as Crowley's personal secretary. During this period, until their bitter parting, Regardie was one of the few who knew Crowley well. He was one of the few who were qualified to provide first-hand, personal insight into the character and personality of one of the major figures in Western Magick. In addition to his extensive writings, Regardie practiced as a chiropractor and as a neo-Reichian therapist. He taught Psychiatry at the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic and contributed articles to many Psychology magazines. <p> David Cherubim, who contributed a Foreword to this book, is a modern-day Adept of the Golden Dawn who was initiated by the late Christopher S. Hyatt on March 10th, 1990, five years after Regardie's death (March 10th, 1985), to carry on Regardie's lineage to Aleister Crowley and the Golden Dawn. David Cherubim is also a musician, author and editor who has edited and contributed material to some of New Falcon's best and most popular titles.</p>"Without Regardie, the Golden Dawn would have perished in the flames of history." --David Cherubim, Israel Regardie Foundation <p> "As a writer, Regardie has long been hailed as one of the most coherent proponents of Western magic. His work is refreshingly humble and honest: he is able to convey difficult, abstract concepts with clarity and openness to inquiry. Never one to talk down to readers, he focuses instead on the patient teaching of esoteric knowledge: his warm style coaxes readers toward further investigation. He invites the reader to join him in the journey on the Path of Light. And it was through Regardie's writings that we began our own Rosicrucian adventure." --Chic and Tabatha Cicero</p></p><h2>How to Prepare and Present a Labor Arbitration Case: Strategy and Tactics for Advocates</h2><p>Before the hearing, during the hearing, and following the hearing--here is your essential guide to achieving winning results in arbitration.

In so doing, he risked death at the hands of the Nazis, one Gestapo leader even urging that he be publicly hanged.

A nobleman, a &#x201c;prince&#x201d; of his people and of his Church, the boy grew into a man, a six-and-a-half-foot tall giant of a man, who, though he loved his homeland, loved God, His Church and His law even more; for he knew that calling his homeland back to the ways of God is the one way in which a bishop can best demonstrate that love for the people under his spiritual care. And so, in three magnificent sermons and countless other speeches, communiques and gestures, the Lion roared.<br><br> This story of his life and his stirring words provides readers with an indispensable glimpse into the confrontation between Church and State in Hitler&#x2019;s Germany and will serve as a reminder to all men and women of good will of the duty to call black &#x2018;black&#x2019; and white &#x2018;white.&#x2019;</p><p>Father Daniel Utrecht is a priest of the Oratory of St Philip Neri, Toronto.

Here, in some of Paul Oskar Kristeller&#39;s most comprehensive and ambitious writings, is an exploration of the distinctive trends and concepts of the Renaissance, grounded in detailed historical investigation.All of these fourteen essays were originally delivered as lectures. Part One identifies the classical sources of Renaissance thought and exposes its essential physiognomy, indicating its humanist, Aristotelian, and Platonist traditions. The next two parts present Renaissance thought in the historical context of the Latin and Greek Middle Ages. Part Four offers a thematic study of Renaissance thought, examining its characteristic conceptions of man&#39;s dignity, destiny, and grasp of truth. Part Five forms a summary from the perspective of a central theme of Renaissance intellectual life and of the entire Western tradition: the relation of language to thought and the seemingly insoluble contest between our literary and philosophical traditions.The reader of &#34;Renaissance Thought and its Sources&#34; enjoys the results of meticulous study in a concise yet comprehensive format. Throughout, Kristeller achieves a graceful blending of sever historical scholarship and adherence to humane values that the editor calls &#34;nearly a lost art in our times.&#34;</p><p>Paul Oskar Kristellar is Frederick J.E.

His career encompassed three well-known high points: the civil rights speech at the 1948 Democratic Convention that risked his political future; his shepherding of the 1964 Civil Rights Act through the Senate; and his near-victory in the 1968 presidential election, one of the angriest and most divisive in the country&#x2019;s history.<br> &nbsp;<br> Historian Arnold A. Offner has explored vast troves of archival records to recapture Humphrey&#x2019;s life, giving us previously unknown details of the vice president&#x2019;s fractious relationship with Lyndon Johnson, showing how Johnson colluded with Richard Nixon to deny Humphrey the presidency, and describing the most neglected aspect of Humphrey&#x2019;s career: his major legislative achievements after returning to the Senate in 1970.

In an exquisitely evocative piece, "The Heart of the Seasons," Elizabeth Hardwick reflects on a time of year that "can make the homely and the humble if not exactly beautiful, beautifully acceptable" and which is lit with magical presences: "the supersonic hummingbird in the browning hydrangea bush." With novelistic brio, Anatole Broyard calls up "a fever of the mind, a bloom of consciousness" found in the sweltering months of his New Orleans boyhood. And in a tight-lipped commentary, Calvin Trillin rues that "summertime in Kansas City was a frenzied, doomed search for chigger nostrums." Other contributions, by Laurie Colwin and John Updike, for example, are strictly occasional, and visually the book seems possessed by the spirit of Edward Hopper (and imitators), with notable exceptions in the art of David Hockney, Robert Adams, Dorothy Low and Walker Evans.

Honoring the influence of Helmut Newton, the images become abstracted body landscapes, the protagonists appearing as mere form, a torso, even a statue.</p><p>A special highlight are previously unseen photographs shot in the Testino studio, in which an exuberant atmosphere intermingles with the implicit frisson of nudity and where playfully amorous dynamics never slip into the obscene or pornographic.</p><p>Testino&#x2019;s lineup ranges from supermodel protagonists, such as Kate Moss and Amber Valletta, to anonymous, androgynous men; from individual portraits to group photos. We see many intimate moments, some caught candidly, some consciously orchestrated, such as a young man shaving a woman&#x2019;s upper pubic hair in a luxurious bathroom. Following in the tradition of SIR, many of the images may be seen to redefine masculine paradigms in the same way that Newton created his own brand of female beauty.</p><p>As emotions, aesthetics, and bodies meet, Testino grants new insight into his world-famous work. The images are accompanied by an introduction from curator Matthias Harder, a candid conversation piece with Carine Roitfeld, as well as an essay from psychiatrist and psychologist Manfred Spitzer who offers a neuroscientific perspective on our visual perception of bodies and beauty.</p></p><p>Matthias Harder is an art historian and chief curator at the Helmut Newton Foundation, Berlin.<br><br>Manfred Spitzer is a German psychiatrist, psychologist and neuroscientist, as well as a popular author in the conjunction of all of these fields.

Perhaps the most determined and inspirational war leader in Britain&#39;s history, it was during that darkest summer of 1940 that Churchill&#39;s astonishing oratory seemed to rally the nation, from his opening statement to the House of Commons on May 13th that he had &#39;nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat&#39;. Each successive crisis produced phrases that have resounded ever since, from the danger of invasion after the evacuation of troops from Dunkirk (&#39;their finest hour&#39;) to the Battle of Britain (his tribute to the &#39;Few&#39;). However, he lost the general election in June 1945. But he returned to Downing Street in 1951, finally retiring in 1955.</p><p>The <b>Life &amp; Times</b> series tells the stories of those who have shaped our present and our past, from Beethoven to Curie, Dietrich to Wilde.

Yet the impact of that discovery and conquest for the European conquering powers has traditionally received less attention. In this pioneering 1992 book J. H. Elliott set out to show how traditional European assumptions about geography, theology, history and the nature of man were challenged by the encounter with new lands and people; trading relationships around the world were affected by an influx of gold and silver imports from America; while politically, the sources of power were no longer confined to European territory. The 500th anniversary of Columbus&#39;s discovery prompted renewed enquiry into the relationship of the Old World and the New; John Elliott&#39;s fascinating and now classic account is here reissued with a new foreword addressing the significance of the book&#39;s insights for a new generation of readers.</p><p>This pioneering work made the first sustained exploration of the consequences for Europe of the discovery and settlement of America, in intellectual, economic, social and political terms.

For Hargrove, becoming an orca trainer fulfilled a childhood dream. However, as his experience with the whales deepened, Hargrove came to doubt that their needs could ever be met in captivity. When two fellow trainers were killed by orcas in marine parks, Hargrove decided that SeaWorld's wildly popular programs were both detrimental to the whales and ultimately unsafe for trainers.</p><p>After leaving SeaWorld, Hargrove became one of the stars of the controversial documentary Blackfish. The outcry over the treatment of SeaWorld's orca has now expanded beyond the outlines sketched by the award-winning documentary, with Hargrove contributing his expertise to an advocacy movement that is convincing both federal and state governments to act.</p><p>In Beneath the Surface, Hargrove paints a compelling portrait of these highly intelligent and social creatures, including his favorite whales Takara and her mother Kasatka, two of the most dominant orcas in SeaWorld. And he includes vibrant descriptions of the lives of orcas in the wild, contrasting their freedom in the ocean with their lives in SeaWorld.</p><p>Hargrove's journey is one that humanity has just begun to take-toward the realization that the relationship between the human and animal worlds must be radically rethought.</p></p><p><p>JOHN HARGROVE has 14 years' experience as a killer whale trainer. His experience spans both SeaWorld of California and SeaWorld of Texas where he was promoted to the highest ranking Senior Trainer. John also has an international reputation, having been a Supervisor with MarineLand in the south of France. He resigned his position with SeaWorld in August 2012 and currently resides in New York City. </p><p>HOWARD CHUA-EOAN was News Director of TIME magazine from 2000 to 2013; he is now a Deputy Managing Editor at Bloomberg Businessweek.</p><p>"You might have watched the documentary Blackfish.

No short phrases can adequately summarize the personalities and idiosyncrasies of the 20 orcas he performed with and cared for, but this book gives us great insight into their piercing intelligence and keen awareness.

Her passion for language was evident from a young age, as she delved into Arabic poetry and novels. The search for a home--what Najwa describes as a place where the soul and heart feel at peace--was central to her early years. When she arrived in Canada at the age of sixteen, she felt unstable and adrift in an unfamiliar place. Nevertheless, she completed her education, and went on to become a teacher as well as a doctoral candidate in educational leadership. Her first students, a group of young refugees, led her back to her original passion: writing. She began to heal her sixteen-year-old self by writing to heal her students. Since self-publishing her first collection of poetry and prose in 2016, Najwa has become an inspiration to millions of people worldwide. Drawing on her own experiences of displacement, discrimination, and abuse, Najwa uses her words to encourage others to build a home within themselves; to live, love, and create fearlessly.</p><h2>Practical Guide To Lameness In Horses</h2><p>This is an updated, practical version of Dr. Stashak&#39;s top selling book Adams&#39; Lameness in Horses, 4th edition.

Through their chant lines and repetitions, sound vibrations, and hypnotically recurring images, hieroglyphs, such as those found inside the pyramids, were intended to activate a trancelike state that allowed the individual to ascend into the heavens and thus, riding on this incantatory language, converse with the ancestors and the Creator. <br><br>In this detailed guide, author Normandi Ellis explores how to use hieroglyphs as words of power for manifesting ideas into the material world as well as how to utilize them in magic, meditation, divination, and dream work. She offers a deep look at the many layers of meaning contained within 60 important hieroglyphs, breaking down the elements within each symbol and explaining the myths behind them, the gods and goddesses they are connected to, their initiatory significance, and their oracular and dream meanings. She also shares guidelines for interpreting hieroglyphs so readers will be able to come to their own understandings about the secrets they hold. <br><br>Providing instructions for creating your own hieroglyph cards, amulets, and other magically empowered objects, Ellis offers practices and strategies to use them, with detailed explanations for the historical, magical, practical, and symbolic reasons why each method is effective. She offers several layouts and card spreads for divination readings based on Egyptian myth, numerology, and astrology. Revealing the depth of meaning behind each of these powerful ancient symbols, Normandi Ellis shows that we can still harness their millennia-old magic today.</p><p>Normandi Ellis is an award-winning writer, workshop facilitator, and director of PenHouse Retreat Center.

To make meditations easier, I drew the images I was seeing onto blank papyrus slips and placed them where I could see them during the meditation. The writing of the oracle notations began after several months of meditations, several dreams, and some encouragement from my spirit guides. <br><br>The more you write or copy a hieroglyph in a notebook with your own hand, the more you inscribe the image into your own flesh. The more often you work with these symbols, the more you will expand your consciousness, your understanding of life, and your ability to create a life around yourself through your attention and intention. The magic is inherent in the hieroglyph itself and lives within you. In other words, each word written in hieroglyphs offers a world to be explored. <br><br>I suggest that you draw these images on papyrus, if you can, or on cardstock. Copy them by hand. Then study the oracle hieroglyphs as you hold each card, imbuing it with your energy and deepening your own understanding of the multiple meanings. <br><br><b><i>Ankh</i></b> <br><br>This ubiquitous, well-known hieroglyph offers messages of renewal, fertility, and eternal life. Nearly everyone who has ever seen the Key of Life knows immediately what it means. Most gods and goddesses, the pharaoh and his queens, and many of the comforting beings in the underworld clasp or offer the ankh. It is the key to the mysteries, the key of life, and the breath of life. <br><br>The ankh particularly invigorates those who have entered the afterlife. For example, the goddess Hathor fondly offers the ankh to her newly departed companion Nefertari in the duat. The goddess holds the ankh to the queen&#x2019;s nose so that she may breathe in the fragrant renewal. Whatever seems to have died--person, project, love--yet it shall be renewed and live again. Like the sa hieroglyph, which the ankh resembles, it offers magical protection. Still others suggest that the ankh may represent a sperm penetrating an ovum at the beginning of life. I do not dispute any of these ideas, believing that these similarities are the way one&#x2019;s mind constellates a fuller poetic meaning of a simple, albeit somewhat abstract, image. <br><br>The ankh, often offered by the hands of goddesses, becomes an especially feminine symbol. Like the thet, the ankh represents the mother and the womb through which everyone of us are connected. That protective, nurturing spirit of the divine and its emblem of self-sacrifice &#x2013; that is, giving one&#x2019;s life to a higher purpose - reappears in later Christian traditions as the sign of the cross. The physical world appears as the cross, or four directions, surmounted by a circle of the eternal.<br><br><b>1.</b> Through all of our incarnations we attain one life eternal; but in this particular body, we have one physical life. Live yours to the fullest. Gather wisdom from all experiences. Become a shining example to others. God gives you life from Life. <br><br><b>2.</b> Live for others. It&#x2019;s all about how we on this planet treat each other and all life forms. The Golden Rule applies. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. You understand that we must all live in like manner: nurturing others as well as ourselves. Listen with your heart. <br><br><b>3.</b> A new creation is coming straight out of your being. You will need to nurture it as it grows. Eventually you will release it and it will live on after you. This could be a creative project or a child. The work takes on a long arc of being; this is only the beginning. <br><br><b>4.</b> Put your work under a microscope. Investigate what will make it pulse with life. Listen with a stethoscope to what you have not been hearing. Hear it now in order to fix any irregularities. Work the &#x201c;Big List&#x201d; of things that you need/want to accomplish today, this month, this year, in your life. Doing is being. <br><br><b>5.</b> Live in the moment. Change things up. Go to the window to gaze out over an expansive vista for inspiration. Life is meant to be enjoyed. Let go of the melodrama. Read some inspiring books or poems; then go about living inside them, or write some poems, or paint some pictures. Your life is grand theatre, enjoy the play. Resurrect some forgotten themes.<br><br><b>6.</b> Our family connections are lifelines to the world. Keep those connections Love Light clear. If there are family riffs, release and forgive. Life&#x2019;s too short for anger. Your body is a temple for Spirit. Care for it. Let hope in. The ankh here may indicate an addition to the family. <br><br><b>7.</b> God is Love. Even when you are alone, your spirit guides love you and work with you to keep you connected to the source. Isis cradles you in her arms. Live an inspiring life to others. Read and emulate someone else&#x2019;s inspiring life. God wants you to embrace your true calling. The power of the ankh celebrates &#x201c;high doing.&#x201d; This means engaging in the spiritual work of learning through life experience that leads us toward tremendous insight and spiritual wisdom. <br><br><b>8.</b> God is in the details. If you are living a life of purpose, every day is a particular day in which particular energies occur and particular things are happening that will never be the same again. You may wish to track them through astrology, numerology, even the colors you wear. Do something that matters for others, for your work, for yourself. In all things, express gratitude. <br><br><b>9.</b> Get rid of distractions that keep you from living in the now. Whatever is passing will transform when you let it go. Something new is rising. The seed must be planted in the dark, which requires radical trust. Prosperity waits in the wings.</p><h2>Letters to His Neighbor</h2><p><p><strong>Brilliantly translated by Lydia Davis, here are Proust&#x2019;s tormented, touching, and often very funny letters to his noisy neighbor.</strong></p><p>Marcel Proust&#x2019;s genius for illuminating pain is on spectacular display in this recently discovered trove of his correspondence, <em>Letters to His Neighbor</em>. Already suffering from noise within his cork-lined walls, his poor soul was not ready for the fresh hell when his neighbor Dr. Williams married a widow with small children.</p><p>Chiefly to Mrs. Williams, these ever-polite letters (often accompanied by flowers, compliments, books, even pheasants) are frequently hilarious&#x2015;Proust couches his fury in a gracious tone. In Lydia Davis&#x2019;s hands, the digressive brilliance of his sentences shines: &#x201c;Don't speak of annoying neighbors, but of neighbors so charming (an association of words contradictory in principle since Montesquiou claims that most horrible of all are 1) neighbors 2) the smell of post offices) that they leave the constant tantalizing regret that one cannot take advantage of their neighborliness.&#x201d;</p><p>Proust makes fine distinctions among his auditory torments: &#x201c;The valet de chambre makes noise and that doesn't matter. But later he knocks with little tiny raps.&nbsp; And that is worse.&#x201d;</p><p>Lydia Davis has written a generous translator&#x2019;s note, tracing much of what we can know about Proust&#x2019;s perpetually dark room; she details the furnishings as well as the life he lived there: burning his powders, talking with friends, hiring musicians, and, most of all, suffering. <em>Letters to His Neighbor</em>is richly illustrated with facsimile letters and photographs&#x2015;catnip for lovers of Proust.</p><p>With an Introduction by Jean-Yves Tadiï¿½ and a translator&#x2019;s note by Lydia Davis.<br></p></p><p><p><strong>Marcel Proust&nbsp;</strong>is arguably the most admired writer of the twentieth century.</p><p><strong>Lydia Davis</strong> is the author of one novel and seven story collections. Her collection <em>Varieties of Disturbance: Stories</em> was a finalist for the 2007 National Book Award. She is the recipient of a MacArthur fellowship, the American Academy of Arts and Letters&#x2019; Award of Merit Medal, and was named a Chevalier of the Order of the Arts and Letters by the French government for her fiction and her translations of modern writers, including Maurice Blanchot, Michel Leiris, and Marcel Proust.&nbsp;Lydia&nbsp;Davis is the winner of the 2013 Man Booker International Prize.</p>&#x201c;I imagine someone discovering these letters and wondering where to put them&#x2015;too quirky, too crazy, too minor, too marginal. But, as we all know, it&#x2019;s the minor and marginal that are often the most interesting. And here the marginalia&#x2015;the addenda and notes&#x2015;are as essential as the letters. The foreword by Proust scholar Jean-Yves Tadiï¿½ and the afterword by celebrated French translator Lydia Davis serve as codes to these letters, through which we catch a glimpse of the writer&#x2019;s idiosyncratic domestic life...&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jeanine Herman, <em>4Columns</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Proust elevated grumbling to an art.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jessica Leigh Hester, <em>City Lab</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;"A collection of letters to the neighbours about noise would seem unpromising material for a book, unless they were written by Marcel Proust, who was so sweet, kind, funny and charming that his letters of complaint, written between 1909 and 1919 to Marie Williams and her husband, are a delightful surprise."&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Daily Telegraph</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Amusing.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Elle</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;One wonders if the headaches of apartment living might even have inspired him, as a worthy enemy might goad one to action.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Harper's</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Even literary greats, it turns out, are not immune to the vagaries of apartment living, as proved by this slim but enchanting volume of recently recovered letters.&nbsp;While living at 102 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris, Proust found his already-frayed nerves and delicate health strained to their breaking point by an office directly overhead belonging to an American dentist. Proust thus embarked on a charm offensive against his neighbors, writing primarily to the dentist's French wife, Marie, who lived with her husband elsewhere in the building. Though born of frustration, the correspondence also brought rewards, as Proust found himself in empathetic accord with this artistically inclined woman, seemingly constrained by her life as a dentist's wife. Proust and Marie also suffered from frequent illnesses, a topic over which they seem to have bonded. The letters start in approximately 1909 and continue until 1916. Though the overall picture is fractured by the fact that we do not have Marie's side of the story, Proust's letters brim with wit, grace, and reflection. Context is provided by an introduction by Proust biographer Jean-Yves Tadiï¿½ and a translator's note by Davis, who previously translated Swann's Way.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Like&nbsp;the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in the caves of Qumran...&nbsp;twenty-six of Proust's letters to his upstairs neighbor, written over a decade during the composition of&nbsp;<em>In Search of Lost Time</em>, will delight any Proustian and will tide the faithful over until new relics come to light.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>David Wiley, <em>Rain Taxi</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Entertaining.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Kevin Canfield, <em>Star Tribune</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;If you have suffered from noisy neighbours, you will sympathize with Marcel Proust.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Times Literary Supplement</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Letters to His Neighbor</em>, brilliantly translated by Lydia Davis, is inadvertently hilarious in hyper-genteel poise; we see Proust at his most desperate, charming to the extreme, an effect no doubt amplified by Davis&#x2019;s elegant prose.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Village Voice</em></strong></p><h2>Harmony and Voice Leading: Workbook (Vol. 1)</h2><p>A clear and accessible volume spanning the entire theory course, HARMONY AND VOICE LEADING, 5th Edition, begins with coverage of basic concepts of theory and harmony and moves into coverage of advanced dissonance and chromaticism. It emphasizes the linear aspects of music as much as the harmonic, and introduces large-scale progressions--linear and harmonic--at an early stage. In the fifth edition, starting with Unit 4, the upper- and lower-case system of Roman numeral analysis has been incorporated to facilitate students&#39; recognition of chord quality. In addition, Schenker&#39;s notion of linear progressions--an important concept in later, more advanced work in tonal analysis--is informally introduced in Unit 11.

He begins his chronicle surprisingly early, in the late '50s and early '60s, when A-bomb protests and books ranging from <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> to <em>Silent Spring</em> and <em>The</em> <em>Feminine Mystique</em> challenged attitudes towards sexuality and the military-industrial complex. As baby boomers went off to college, drug use increased, women won more social freedom, and the widespread availability of birth control pills eased inhibitions against premarital sex. Lytle describes how in 1967 these isolated trends began to merge into the mainstream of American life. The counterculture spread across the nation, Black Power dominated the struggle for racial equality, and political activists mobilized vast numbers of dissidents against the war. It all came to a head in 1968, with the deepening morass of the war, the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., race riots, widespread campus unrest, the violence at the Democratic convention in Chicago, and the election of Richard Nixon. By then, not only did Americans divide over race, class, and gender, but also over matters as simple as the length of a boy's hair or of a girl's skirt. Only in the aftermath of Watergate did the uncivil wars finally crawl to an end, leaving in their wake a new elite that better reflected the nation's social and cultural diversity. <br> Blending a fast-paced narration with broad cultural analysis, <em>America's Uncivil Wars</em> offers an invigorating portrait of the most tumultuous and exciting time in modern American history.</p><p><br><strong>Mark Hamilton Lytle</strong> is a Professor of History and Director of the Historical Studies Program and is Codirector of the American Studies Program at Bard College.

It moves forward relentlessly, omnivorously, in torrents of precise and well-paced prose. It should be viewed, primarily, as a newsreel, a Bayeaux Tapestry, a mural in some palace of memory.

Impoverished, ill, and hungry, the miners inspire ï¿½tienne to attempt a revolt against the Company, an overthrow of &#x201c;the tyranny of capital, which was starving the worker.&#x201d; They answer his desperate call for a strike that grows increasingly violent and divisive, testing loyalties and endangering ï¿½tienne&#x2019;s life even as it offers the workers their only hope of a decent existence. In a harrowing climax, the unforeseen consequences of the strike threaten to engulf them all in disaster.&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LSTRONG&amp;&amp;RDominique Jullien&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R is a professor of French at Columbia University and the University of California&#x2013;Santa Barbara, and the editor in chief of the &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RRomanic Review&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R.

Zola approached each one of his novels with extensive research; he was particularly thorough in this and complemented his factual research with a visit to the real location of his story. He first read extensively&#x2014;on the mining industry, the mining regions of northern France, the daily lives of miners, technical innovations in the pits, and working-class political movements. Then, at the end of February 1884, for about a week he visited the mining country. He talked to engineers, entered miners&#x2019; houses, went deep down into the mining tunnels, and observed the small mining town of Anzin, where a strike had just begun. His voluminous &#x201c;Notes sur Anzin&#x201d; (&#x201c;Notes on Anzin&#x201d;; see the Gallimard edition of <i>Les Rougon-Macquart</i>, listed in &#x201c;For Further Reading&#x201d;)<b> </b>form an extraordinary record of personal impressions and factual information. Zola was very careful to avoid anachronism. Between the late 1860s, when the novel takes place, and 1884, when Zola took notes for his novel, things had been changing in the coal mines,<b> </b>although the technical methods of extraction hadn&#x2019;t altered dramatically, and the miners&#x2019; living conditions remained miserable and were made worse by rising prices and an economic slump. In <i>Germinal </i>we find women, as young as twelve and as old as forty, working in the mines. Women were paid half of a man&#x2019;s wages. Children of eleven worked fourteen-hour days. Strikes were illegal and often ended in bloody confrontations with the army. But miners were beginning to agitate for better conditions. A series of dramatic strikes in the last years of the Second Empire shocked public opinion and inspired the strike scenes in <i>Germinal</i>. In 1869 the army fired into the crowd of striking miners at La Ricamarie, killing thirteen, including two women. Another fourteen died later in similar circumstances at Aubin. But slowly miners, like workers elsewhere, were organizing to improve their lot. Little by little, the labor laws restricting workers&#x2019; rights were relaxed. Workers&#x2019; associations gradually became more tolerated. Protective laws were implemented: For example, in 1874 women could no longer be employed underground, and children under twelve were not allowed to work in the mines at all. Solidarity among workers improved, as support for ill, injured, and striking workers was more effectively organized. Karl Marx&#x2019;s <i>Manifest Der Kommunistischen Partei</i> (<i>Manifesto of the Communist Party</i>)<i> </i>was published in 1848. In 1864 Marx helped found the International Workingmen&#x2019;s Association in London; this &#x201c;First International&#x201d; helped radicalize workers&#x2019; movements in France. And the French translation of <i>Das Kapital </i>(1867, first volume) was published beginning in 1875. Hard-line Marxism, with its intransigent theory of class warfare, came to dominate Labor&#x2013;Capital<b> </b>relations. This is clearly shown in the novel. <i>Germinal </i>weaves the story of the hero&#x2019;s political education into the background story of the miners&#x2019; plight. When ï¿½tienne Lantier first comes to Montsou, he is poor and ignorant. His mind is as barren as the dark plain of the mining country. But when he emerges from the flooded mine at the end of the novel, ï¿½tienne is poised to become a professional revolutionary, leaving behind both nihilistic terrorism and conciliatory reformism. </p><p>Zola&#x2019;s novel is a fascinating document on the political movements of the time. Rasseneur, who owns the cafï¿½ where miners gather to drink and talk, embodiees the moderates, the supporters of cooperation between Labor and Capital. The moderates are pitted against socialist<b> </b>politicians like Pluchart, the hero&#x2019;s role model, who is sent by the International to organize and indoctrinate miners of the northern region of France.<b> </b>At the heart of the novel lies the ideological rivalry between Rasseneur and ï¿½tienne and their battle for the miners&#x2019; hearts and minds. ï¿½tienne&#x2019;s superior education and rousing rhetorical skills soon give him precedence over Rasseneur, who is booed by the miners when he tries to speak against the strike (part four, chapter VII). But after the catastrophic failure of the strike, it is ï¿½tienne&#x2019;s turn to experience loss of popularity. When the enraged miners throw bricks at him, he is rescued by Rasseneur, who calms the mob with his soothing eloquence, and who<b> </b>is once again cheered as its leader.<b> </b>Later, the two men have a drink together and bond over their shared disillusionment with the savagery of the crowd (part seven, chapter I). Yet in the last chapter, ï¿½tienne, called to Paris by Pluchart to join the Paris section of the International, is once again reconciled with the miners. The silent handshakes he exchanges with them on the morning of his departure acknowledge that they once again accept him as their leader and count on him, rather than Rasseneur, to lead them to victory (part seven, chapter VI). Zola&#x2019;s portrayal of his hero as a Marxist revolutionary in the making is masterful. He shows ï¿½tienne&#x2019;s transformation from a young and rather incompetent worker to a self-taught zealot and an ambitious <i>dï¿½classï¿½</i>, who fights for the working classes but feels superior to them. (ï¿½tienne&#x2019;s culture is a medley of popularized Darwinism, undigested Marxism, and elements of anarchism lifted from social theorist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin.) Zola&#x2019;s ambivalence toward professional revolutionaries<b> </b>is obvious&#x2014;Pluchart, the elusive and ambitious apparatchik, who uses the miners&#x2019; discontent for his own political promotion and spends barely enough time in Montsou to collect party memberships (part four, chapter IV), is hardly idealized. But, curiously, ï¿½tienne is not idealized either. He is &#x201c;intoxicated with this first enjoyment of popularity&#x201d;, and later he hardens into a sectarian collectivist when he convinces the miners at a secret meeting in the woods that the new communist society is around the corner (part four, chapter VII). He is too pleased with his own pedantry. He is an irresponsible revolutionary whose fiery speeches about a better future bring tragedy to his comrades.</p><p></p></p><h2>Finding Jobs With a Psychology Bachelor&#39;s Degree: Expert Advice for Launching Your Career</h2><p>Psychology is one of the most popular college majors and can lead to a satisfying career in many different fields.

As she discerns the impact and meaning of the European effect on the islands, she demonstrates how, during the early contact period, the mythologies of Europe and Tahiti intersected and became entwined. Drawing on Tahitian oral histories, European manuscripts and artworks, collections of Tahitian artifacts, and illustrated with contemporary sketches, paintings, and engravings from the voyages, <i>Aphrodite's Island</i> provides a vivid account of the Europeans' Tahitian adventures. At the same time, the book's compelling insights into Tahitian life significantly change the way we view the history of this small island during a period when it became a crossroads for Europe.</p><p>"This book offers a fresh history of early Tahiti, considerably richer than any published before, imaginative in its speculations around local cosmology and local meanings, but also precise in its reconstruction of the political relationships that evolved with the early visits of the British, French, and Spanish.

I had a lot of big accomplishments, and I made a lot of big mistakes. One of the biggest mistakes I ever made was when I gave everyone in our family everything that they thought they ever wanted.

He has a special plan for each of us, and he has provided everything we need to fulfill that plan. I spent many years trying to achieve happiness or buy it for friends and family. Only as an old man did I come to learn that all happiness comes from the gifts that God has given us. Unfortunately, the money and possessions I spread around didn't help people to understand the gifts that have been provided for us.

He didn't turn around but instead let his gaze fall to the busy city below. A deep sadness tangled his words, so he took a moment to compose himself. The inevitable had finally come, but it didn't make it any easier. </p> <p> He stayed at the window as he addressed Miss Hastings. </p> <p> "Contact family members, the various corporate boards and business interests . . ." He sighed. There was a lot to take care of. Now wasn't the time to mourn. And Hamilton knew that perhaps he mourned more for what Red had endured in life. </p> <p> Red was at peace now, but there would be nothing resembling peace in the wake of his death. "And let's call a meeting." </p> <p> "Yes, sir," Miss Hastings said. She turned to leave the room, then stopped and turned back to Hamilton. "Sir, I am so sorry for your loss." She pulled the heavy oak doors of his office closed. </p> <p> Clutching his cane, he gazed out the dark window and wondered how well he would be able to tolerate the wolves that had been waiting and circling for days now. Oh, yes, they would put on their sad faces. Some of them. Others would adopt a false solicitousness. No matter. Everything was set into motion now; no man could change it. And he doubted it would change any man, either. </p> <p> But for a man whose life had gone terribly wrong in so many different ways, he'd had hope all the way to the end. </p> <p> Hamilton closed his eyes. The older he got, the less he held out much optimism for anything. But maybe, just maybe, he had a little, too. </p> <p> His mind wandered back to the first time he'd ever heard Red's voice. It had been a phone call, placed to Hamilton right after he'd graduated from law school. </p> <p> "Am I speaking with Theophilus Hamilton?" </p> <p> "Sir, yes--Yes, sir. This is he." </p> <p> "Name's Howard Stevens. You can call me Red. I need a lawyer for a few business ideas I have, a few still in the dream stage." </p> <p> Hamilton smiled now. Red Stevens and his dreams. He was at peace. But Theophilus understood peace would not be a part of his own immediate future. </p> <p>* * * </p> <p>The day couldn't have been grayer. Hamilton stood near the pastor, surveying the five-hundred-plus mourners who clustered around the shiny mahogany casket of Red Stevens. Flowers, bright and white, were the only color among a graveyard filled with stately, above ground tombs and important people all dressed in suitable dark clothing, every single one carrying a black umbrella. </p> <p> Their faces reflected more aversion to the rain they were forced to stand in than to the death of the man they were here to lament. Behind the mourners and down the hill a little, Hamilton spotted one pink umbrella, which was doing a poor job of protecting its keeper from the rain, since the young girl wasn't putting it over her head. Instead, she seemed to be the only one embracing the moment, with her face tilted upward to the sky as it bathed her in wetness. </p> <p> Hamilton sighed. Oh, how he wished there could be more of that kind of goodness and innocence in the world. </p> <p> The pastor, hunched under his own black umbrella, cupping his little black book, was doing his best to uphold the sanctity of the moment. "Though the skies may weep," he said, "the Bible assures us that 'precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.'" </p> <p> No one--near Hamilton, anyway--looked as though they cared at all what the Bible said. Red's two sons, Bill and Jack, stood just three feet away, oblivious to the idea they were supposed to appear sorrowful. </p> <p> "I wonder who the old man negotiated with for the rain," Jack said with a cynical smile to Bill, Red's oldest. </p> <p> "Well, it's a sure bet he's laughing, watching us get soaked." </p> <p> "Yeah, well, now it's his turn," Jack said. </p> <p> "There's not a person here," the pastor continued, "whose life in some way has not been touched by Howard 'Red' Stevens." </p> <p> Hamilton watched Jack and Bill glance at each other and roll their eyes. Jack, the playboy of the family, pulled up the sleeve of his coat and looked at his watch. Bill glanced down at some sort of organizing device or cell phone in his hand, then quietly put it back in his pocket. It was all Hamilton could do not to say something, but that wasn't his way. And it hadn't been Red's either. He'd let his children become what they'd become. He'd tried a time or two to step in and talk some sense into any of them who would listen, but they never listened unless he was talking in the language of dollar signs. </p> <p> Hamilton's gaze found its way back to the little girl, who seemed intent on getting wet. He wondered why such a young girl felt the need to wear such dark lipstick. She couldn't have been more than ten years old, but her lips were stained the color of wine grapes. What was the world coming to? But he smiled as the mother suddenly noticed the umbrella to her side and rushed to put it back in its place, much to the young girl's disappointment. </p> <p> "Red often quoted Malcolm Muggeridge," the pastor said to a crowd growing more agitated with every wet minute that went by, "saying that 'every happening, great or small, is a parable by which God speaks to us; and the art of life is to get the message.' </p> <p> May the message of Red Stevens continue in the hearts of those he leaves behind." </p> <p> The pastor seemed to sense he was losing their interest. He turned to Bill. "Bill?" He gestured toward the casket. </p> <p> "Uh . . . yes," Bill said, stepping forward. Reaching into his coat, he pulled out a small canister. "Even though Dad moved his corporate offices from Texas many years ago, for tax reasons, he always said he wanted to be buried under Texas soil." He opened the canister and shook some dirt onto the casket, then stepped back. </p> <p> Somebody touched Hamilton's elbow. He didn't have to turn around. He knew it was Miss Hastings, assuring him he was right for keeping silent and avoiding a scene. </p> <p> Suddenly the loud rumblings of a car caused the entire crowd to turn as a vintage 1971 Dodge Charger R/T slowed on the small cemetery road below. What little dirt was left on the casket fell off as the ground shook from the revving engine. Hamilton could hardly stop himself from throwing up his hands in disgust. But then again, neither could the other mourners, whose mouths hung open at the sight of the yellow-and-black muscle car roaring to a stop in front of them. </p> <p> The young man getting out of the car was apparently the only one who hadn't gotten the family memo about what kind of etiquette was expected. He flung the car door open, nursing a cigarette and likely a bad hangover, judging by the state of his clothes and hair. Some hideous rock-and-roll song thumped against the backdrop of the rainstorm, until he turned it off and rose out of the car. He wore black sunglasses and an expression that might've been worse if they could see his eyes. Beside him an expressionless young woman appeared in a taut black dress that spoke to the idea she might be at the wrong social event. </p> <p> "Is that him?" Miss Hastings whispered. </p> <p> "That's him." Hamilton sighed. He watched Jason Stevens walk up the small hill, dismissing his cigarette as he tossed it aside into a puddle. He also dismissed his girlfriend and two others who had crawled unsteadily from the backseat of the car, walking ahead of all of them and heading straight for his mother, Sarah. </p> <p> "Mom," he said. </p> <p> Even with all the Botox she'd managed over the years, his mother was able to lift her eyebrows high in a frightful expression of embarrassment and shock.

All the information you need to know is in this extremely readable narrative -- all the drama, the intrigue, plus all the important background information of most interest to Christians. Part of &#34;The Christian Library&#34; series.</p><p>A member of a wealthy priestly family in Judea, Josephus was a Pharisee originally named Joseph ben Matthias. An active supporter of anti-Roman activity, he became governor of Galilee, a post he held with honor and valor until Galilee was taken by the Romans in a.d. 67. He won the favor of the Roman general Vespasian, whose name---Flavius---he took as his own and through whose patronage he later became a Roman citizen. Although often criticized for becoming a supporter of Rome, in his work Against Apion he passionately defends Jewish religion and culture. Josephus wrote both in Greek and in Hebrew. His writings are neither remarkably fine representatives of classical culture nor the product of deep learning in Jewish literature and history. They do, however, tell the reader a great deal not known from other sources. The Jewish War (75--79), based to a great extent on what Josephus himself saw, heard, and experienced, describes the tragic events of the Jewish revolt against Rome. Antiquities of the Jews (93) covers the history of the Jews from creation to the war with Rome, with special attention given to the Maccabees and the dynasty of Herod.</p><h2>Beneath a Scarlet Sky (Center Point Large Print)</h2><p>Based on the true story of a forgotten hero, <i>Beneath a Scarlet Sky</i> is the triumphant, epic tale of one young man&#x2019;s incredible courage and resilience during one of history&#x2019;s darkest hours.</p><p><p>Mark Sullivan is the acclaimed author of eighteen novels, including the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Private series, which he writes with James Patterson.

His dissolute bohemian life was as shocking to his nineteenth-century readers as his poetry. Writing in classical style but with brutal honesty, Baudelaire laid bare human suffering, aspirations, and perversions.</p><p>Charles Baudelaire (1821-67) has proved to be the most influential of French nineteenth-century poets for the way in which his writing combines strong emotion, acute aesthetic sensibility and formal perfection with the everyday settings and language of the modern city. This volume contains 102 poems, including ninety-two from the 1861 edition of Les Fleurs du Mal and nine from the Petits Poemes en Prose together with plain prose translations by Carol Clark.<b>Charles-Pierre Baudelaire</b> was born in Paris in 1821. He travelled to the Indian Ocean but returned prematurely and never again travelled far from Paris, until his journey to Belgium the year before his death, where he suffered a stroke. He lived a bohemian lifestyle, writing, publishing and lecturing to raise money for his rather lavish tastes.

Elizabeth is married to the novelist and illustrator Edward Carey.Something Amazing<br><br>Just west of Boston, just north of the turnpike, the ghost of Missy Goodby sleeps curled up against the cyclone fence at the dead end of Winter Terrace, dressed in a pair of ectoplasmic dungarees. That thumping noise is Missy bopping a plastic Halloween pumpkin on one knee; that flash of light in the corner of a dark porch is the moon off the glasses she wore to correct her lazy eye. Late at night when you walk your dog and feel suddenly cold, and then unsure of yourself, and then loathed by the world, that&#x2019;s Missy Goodby, too, hissing as she had when she was alive and six years old, I hate you, you stink, you smell, you baby.<br><br>The neighborhood kids remember Missy. She bit when she was angry and pinched no matter what. They don&#x2019;t feel sorry for her ghost self. They remember the funeral they were forced to attend after she died, how her mother threw herself on the coffin, wailing, how they thought she was kidding and so laughed out loud and got shushed. The way the neighborhood kids tell the story, the coffin was lowered into the ground and Missy Goodby&#x2019;s grieving mother leapt down and then had to be yanked from the hole like a weed. Everyone always believes the better story eventually. Really, Joyce Goodby just thumped the coffin at the graveside service. Spanked it: two little spanks, nothing serious. She knew that pleading would never budge her daughter, not because she was dead but because she was stubborn. All her life, the more you pleaded with Missy, the more likely she was to do something to terrify you. Joyce Goodby spanked the coffin and walked away and listened for footsteps behind her. She walked all the way home, where she took off her shoes, black pumps with worn stones of gray along the toes. &#x201c;Done with you,&#x201d; she told them.<br>The soul is liquid, and slow to evaporate. The body&#x2019;s a bucket and liable to slosh. Grieving, haunted, heartbroken, obsessed: your friends will tell you to cheer up. What they really mean is dry up. But it isn&#x2019;t a matter of will. Only time and light will do the job.<br><br>Who wants to, anyhow?<br><br>Best keep in the dark and nurse the damp. Cover the mirrors, keep the radio switched off. Avoid the newspaper, the television, the whole outdoors, anywhere little girls congregate, though the world is manufacturing them hand over fist, though there are now, it seems, more little girls living in the world than any other variety of human being. Or middle-aged men whose pants don&#x2019;t fit, or infant boys, or young women with wide, sympathetic, fretful foreheads. Whatever you have lost there are more of, just not yours. Sneeze. Itch. Gasp for breath. Seal the windows. Replace the sheets, then the mattresses. Pry the mercury from your teeth. Buy appliances to scrub the air.<br><br>Even so, the smell of the detergent from the sheets will fall into your nose. The chili your nice son cooks will visit you in the bedroom. The sweat from his clothes when he runs home from high school, the fog of his big yawping shoes, the awful smell of batteries loaded into a remote control, car exhaust, the plastic bristles on your toothbrush, the salt-air smell of baking soda once you give up toothpaste. Make your house as safe and airtight as possible. Filter the air, boil the water: the rashes stay, the wheezing gets worse.<br><br>What you are allergic to can walk through walls.<br>The neighborhood kids don&#x2019;t remember what Joyce Goodby looked like back when she regularly drove down Winter Terrace; they&#x2019;ve forgotten her curly black hair, her star-and-moon earrings, her velvet leggings. It&#x2019;s been five years. Now that she&#x2019;s locked away, they know everything about her. She no longer cuts or colors her mercury hair but instead twists it like a towel and pins it to her head. The paper face mask she wears over her nose and mouth makes her eyes look big. Her clothes are unbleached cotton and hemp; an invalid could eat them. She and her son, Gerry, used to look alike, a pair of freckled hearty people. Not anymore. Her freckles have starved from lack of light. Her eyebrows are thick, her eyelashes thin. She seems made of soap and steel wool.<br><br>Something&#x2019;s wrong in the neighborhood, she tells her son, it gave Missy lymphoma and now it&#x2019;s made her sick.<br><br>Of course she&#x2019;s a witch. The older kids tell younger kids, and kids who live on the street tell the kids round the corner. The Winter Terrace Witch, they call her, as though she&#x2019;s a seventeenth-century legend. She eats children. She kills them. She killed her own daughter a million years ago.<br><br>Some gangly kid not even from the street tells Santos and Johnny Mackers about the witch and the ghost. The Mackerses have just moved to Winter Terrace. Santos is nine years old, with curly hair and a strange accent, the result of nearly a decade of post-nasal drip. Johnny is as tough a five-year-old as ever was, a preschool monster Santos has created on the sly. Santos steals their father&#x2019;s Kools and lights them for Johnny. He has taught Johnny all the swears he knows, taught him how to punch, all in hopes that their mother will love Johnny a little less and him a little more. It&#x2019;s not working. Already they&#x2019;re famous on the street, where no one has ever seen Johnny Mackers&#x2019;s feet touch the ground. He rides his Big Wheel everywhere: up and down the street and into the attached garage. He rides it directly into the cyclone fence.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a crazy motherfucker,&#x201d; Santos says. &#x201c;A crazy motherfucker.&#x201d; He doesn&#x2019;t like the word himself but Johnny won&#x2019;t learn it otherwise.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Ghostland, by the fence,&#x201d; the gangly kid says, from the other side. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where all the ghosts get caught, that&#x2019;s why they call it a dead end.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nosir,&#x201d; says Santos.<br><br>&#x201c;Yessir,&#x201d; says the kid. &#x201c;Dead girl ghost. Plus there&#x2019;s a witch.&#x201d; He spits to be tough but he hasn&#x2019;t practiced enough: he just drools, then walks away, embarrassed.<br><br>Johnny Mackers is swarthy and black-haired and Italian-looking, like his mother; Santos has his Irish father&#x2019;s looks. He likes to shut Johnny into things. Already he&#x2019;s investigated the locks of their new house. The attic, the basement, the mirror-fronted closet in their parents&#x2019; room: every lock sounds different, key, slide bolt, knob, hook-and-eye, dead bolt. He&#x2019;s glad to learn of a ghost to threaten Johnny with. &#x201c;The dead girl wants to kiss you. Here she comes. Pucker up.&#x201d; But the dead girl isn&#x2019;t interested, and Johnny Mackers knows it. The neighborhood kids are lying when they say they see her. The dead girl doesn&#x2019;t watch as Santos stuffs Johnny into the front hall closet. The dead girl doesn&#x2019;t see the fingers at the bottom of the door, or the foot that stomps on them. She doesn&#x2019;t see Mrs. Mackers open up the door an hour later, saying, &#x201c;What are you doing in there, for Pete&#x2019;s sake? The way you hide, it drives me nuts. Why don&#x2019;t you go ride your bike. Go on, now.&#x201d; The dead girl doesn&#x2019;t sleep outside, ever. Why would she? She is with her mother, who--as she cleans the kitchen (her eyesight so vigilant she can see individual motes of dust, a single bacterium scuttling along the countertop)--can hear the mortar-and-pestle sound of a plastic wheel grinding along the grit of the gutter, a noise that should surely mean more than a grimy black-haired boy getting from one end of the street to another.<br>A different child might have turned into a different kind of ghost, visible only to little children, a finder of lost balls, a demander of candy. She could have visited Johnny Mackers late at night, when he plotted how he would kill his brother Santos. She could have haunted Santos himself. She could have accomplished things.<br><br>Instead, she likes to snuffle close to her mother&#x2019;s skin. The best spot is Joyce&#x2019;s skin in the hollow just below her cheekbones and just above her jaw: you have to get close, you have to get nearly under Joyce&#x2019;s nose to settle in. Sometimes Missy gets in the way and cuts off her mother&#x2019;s breath. She doesn&#x2019;t mean to. The biting, pinching child bites and pinches, along her mother&#x2019;s arms, her pale stomach.<br><br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; Joyce says to her son, and displays her forearms, which are captioned with strange anaglyphic sentences, spelled out in hives.<br><br>Gerry Goodby was twelve when his little sister died. Now he&#x2019;s a seventeen-year-old six-foot-tall lacrosse player. He has watched his mother turn from a human woman into some immaculate vegetable substance, wan, thin, lamplit. What will you do, his father says. He means about college. For the past five years, Gerry and his father have had the same alternating conversation. I want to live with you, Gerry will say, and his father will answer, You know that&#x2019;s impossible, you know your mother needs you. Or his father will say, This is crazy, she&#x2019;s crazy, come live with me, and Gerry will answer, You know that&#x2019;s impossible.<br><br>He was the one who closed up Missy&#x2019;s room. A year after she died, his mother wheezing, weeping, molting on the sofa. She gave him the directions. Don&#x2019;t touch a thing. Just seal it up. He nailed over the doorway with barrier cloth, then painted over that with latex paint. His mother felt better for nearly a month.<br><br>Sometimes he stops in the hallway and touches the slumped wall where Missy&#x2019;s door used to be. He feels like a projection on a screen, waiting for the rest of the movie to be filled in. This is intolerable, he thinks. He&#x2019;s always thought of intolerable as a grown-up word, like mortgage.<br><br>Missy the allergen, Missy the poison. She&#x2019;s everywhere in the house, no matter how their mother scrubs and sweeps and burns and purges. She&#x2019;s in the bricks. She&#x2019;s in the new bedding, in the nontoxic cleaning fluid. She leeches and fumes and wishes--insofar as ghosts can, in the way that water wishes, and has a will, sometimes thwarted and sometimes not--that the house were not shut up so tight. She rises to the ceiling daily and collects there, drips down, tries again. Outside there&#x2019;s a world of blank skin, waiting for her to scribble all over it.<br><br>&#x201c;I would die without you,&#x201d; Joyce Goodby tells her son one morning. He knows it&#x2019;s true, just as he knows he&#x2019;s the only one who would care. Sometimes he thinks it wouldn&#x2019;t be such a bad bargain, his mother&#x2019;s death for his own freedom. Anyone would understand. Anyhow, it&#x2019;s time to leave for school. She won&#x2019;t die during the school day; at least, she hasn&#x2019;t so far.<br><br>Across the street Santos shuts Johnny Mackers in a steamer trunk in the attic instead of walking him to kindergarten. Then Santos, liberated, guilty, decides to skip school himself. He walks to the corner and gets on the bus that says, across its forehead, DOWNTOWN VIA PIKE. He has just enough change to pay his fare. The bus is crammed with people. A man in a gray windbreaker stands up. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Kiddo. Sit here.&#x201d;<br><br>Santos sits.<br>The world goes on. The world will. At any moment you can look from your window and see your neighbors. The fat couple who live next door will bicker and then bear hug each other. The teenage boys will play basketball with their shirts off. The elderly lady next door waits for the visiting nurse; her bloodhound snoozes in the sun like a starlet, one paw across his snout. You want to drape that old, good, big dog&#x2019;s sun-warmed fawn-colored ears on your fists. You want to reassure the elderly lady, tease the fat couple, watch--just watch--those shirtless, heedless boys. You have to get out, your family says, it&#x2019;s time. It&#x2019;s time to join the world again. But you never left the world. You&#x2019;re filled with tenderness, with worry for every living being, but you can&#x2019;t do anything--not for your across-the-street neighbors, or for the people on the next street, or around the corner, or driving on the turnpike two blocks away, or in the city, or the whole country, the whole world, west and east and north and south. You are so unlucky you don&#x2019;t want to brush up against anyone who isn&#x2019;t.<br><br>You will not join a group. You will not read a book. You&#x2019;re not interested in anyone else&#x2019;s story, not when your own story takes up all your time. When the calamity happened, your friends said, It&#x2019;s so sad. It&#x2019;s the worst kind of luck, and you could tell they believed it. What&#x2019;s changed? You are as sad and unlucky as you were when it happened. It&#x2019;s still so, so sad. It&#x2019;s still the worst kind of luck.<br><br>The dead live on in the homeliest of ways. They&#x2019;re listed in the phone book. They get mail. Their wigs rest on Styrofoam heads at the back of closets. Their beds are made. Their shoes are everywhere.<br>The paint across the door is still tacky. It&#x2019;s dumb to even be here. Joyce swears she can smell the fiberboard headboard of the bed through the barrier cloth, the scratch-and-sniff stickers on the desk, the old lip gloss, the bubble bath in containers shaped like animals arranged on the dresser top, the unchanged mattress, the dust. The dress from Bloomingdale&#x2019;s that had been hers and then Missy&#x2019;s, in striped fabric like a railroad engineer&#x2019;s hat. The Mexican jumping beans bought at a joke shop before the diagnosis, four dark little beans in a plastic box with a clear top and blue bottom that clasped shut like an old-fashioned change purse. You warmed them in your hands, and they woke up and twitched and flipped: the worms who lived inside dozed in the cold but threw themselves against the walls when the temperature rose.<br><br>&#x201c;Worms?&#x201d; Missy had asked. Her nose was lacy with freckles, pink around the rim. &#x201c;How do we feed them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; said Joyce.<br><br>&#x201c;Then they&#x2019;ll starve to death!&#x201d;<br><br>Quickly Joyce made up a story: the worm wasn&#x2019;t a worm, it was a soul. It was fine where it was, it was eternal, and if the bean stopped moving that only meant the soul had moved on to find another home. Back to Mexico? asked Missy, and Joyce said, Sure, why not. (Who knows? Maybe that&#x2019;s why the worms woke up when they got warm--they thought, At last we&#x2019;re back home in Oaxaca.) Back then, reincarnation was a comforting fable. In fairy tales, people were always born again as beasts, frogs, migrating swans.<br><br>Now Joyce feels the world shake and thinks, Mexican jumping bean. She can&#x2019;t decide whether the house is the bean and she&#x2019;s the worm, or the bean&#x2019;s her body and the worm her soul.<br><br>Neither: someone has wrenched open the wooden storm door of the sun porch and let it slam behind him. Then the doorbell rings.</p><h2>The House on Walenska Street</h2><p>Relates the experiences of eight-year-old Leah, her two younger sisters, and their widowed mother living in a small Russian town in 1913.</p><p>Grade 3-5 --Esther, Rose, and Leah live with their mother in a small village in Russia around the turn of the century. Their father has recently died, and their mother supports the family by baking bread and renting a corner of the small house to Zimmel, the cobbler. Little Esther is always getting into scrapes, much to the annoyance--and amusement--of big sister Leah. Letters to and from relatives in faraway Minnesota are a highlight of life, as is a chance to run an errand that takes one past the shop windows in the village. Small details of Jewish life and customs are woven into the simple story. Herman tells her tale with obvious affection for the characters, and, while the ending is a bit abrupt, the overall effect is warmly nostalgic. Aimed at a slightly younger audience than many of her other novels, this will appeal to readers of Miriam Chaikin's books about Yossi, or Carol Snyder's stories about Ike and Mama. --Elaine Fort Weischedel, Turner Free Library, Randolph, MA<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Shadow Lamp (Bright Empires, Quest the 4th) (Bright Empires, 4)</h2><p><p><strong>The quest for answers&#x2014;and ultimate survival&#x2014;hinges on finding the cosmic link between the Skin Map, the Shadow Lamp, and the Spirit Well.</strong></p><p>The search for the map of blue symbols began in a rainy alley in London but has since expanded through space and time and includes more seekers.</p><p>Kit, Mina, Gianni, Cass, Haven, and Giles have gathered in Mina&#x2019;s 16th-century coffee house and are united in their determination to find a path back to the Spirit Well.
